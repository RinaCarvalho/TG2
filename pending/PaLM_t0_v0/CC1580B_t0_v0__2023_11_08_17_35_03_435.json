{"prompt": "Let c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_n be a permutation of integers 1, 2, \u2026, n. Consider all subsegments of this permutation containing an integer x. Given an integer m, we call the integer x good if there are exactly m different values of maximum on these subsegments. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). A sequence a is a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Given four integers n, m, k and p, write a function to count the number of permutations of length n with exactly k good numbers, modulo p. The function must receive four integers n, m, k and p and return an integer.", "response": "\ndef count_permutations(n, m, k, p):\n  \"\"\"Counts the number of permutations of length n with exactly k good numbers, modulo p.\"\"\"\n\n  # Initialize the dp table.\n  dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n\n  # Base case: There are no permutations of length 0.\n  dp[0][0] = 1\n\n  # Iterate over all lengths of permutations.\n  for i in range(1, n + 1):\n    # Iterate over all numbers of good numbers.\n    for j in range(k + 1):\n      # If there are no good numbers, then there is only one permutation.\n      if j == 0:\n        dp[i][j] = 1\n      # Otherwise, there are two cases:\n      # 1.
