{"prompt": "The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t. Write a function to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there are exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.", "response": "\ndef min_changes(a, b):\n    n = len(a)\n    m = len(b)\n    dp = [[0] * (n - m + 2) for _ in range(2)]\n    for i in range(n - m + 1):\n        dp[0][i] = -1\n    for i in range(m):\n        for j in range(n - m + 1):\n            if a[i + j] == b[i]:\n                dp[1][j] = dp[0][j]\n            else:\n                dp[1][j] = min(dp[0][j], dp[1][j - 1]) + 1\n        for j in range(n - m + 1):\n            dp[0][j] = dp[1][j]\n    return dp[0]\n\na = input()\nb = input()\nprint(*min_changes(a, b))\n"}
