{"prompt": "Polycarp likes squares and cubes of positive integers. Here is the beginning of the sequence of numbers he likes: 1, 4, 8, 9, .... For a given number n, write a function to count the number of integers from 1 to n that Polycarp likes. In other words, find the number of such x that x is a square of a positive integer number or a cube of a positive integer number (or both a square and a cube simultaneously). The function must receive an integer n, and return an integer.", "response": " 3\ndef count_polycarp_numbers(n):\n  \"\"\"Counts the number of integers from 1 to n that Polycarp likes.\n\n  Args:\n    n: An integer.\n\n  Returns:\n    An integer.\n  \"\"\"\n\n  # Initialize a set to store the squares and cubes of positive integers.\n  squares_and_cubes = set()\n\n  # Add the squares of positive integers to the set.\n  for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n    squares_and_cubes.add(i * i)\n\n  # Add the cubes of positive integers to the set.\n  for i in range(1, int(n ** (1 / 3)) + 1):\n    squares_and_cubes.add(i * i * i)\n\n  # Return the number of elements in the set.\n  return len(squares_and_cubes)\n"}
