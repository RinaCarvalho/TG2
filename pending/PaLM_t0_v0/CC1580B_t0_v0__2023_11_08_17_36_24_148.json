{"prompt": "Let c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_n be a permutation of integers 1, 2, \u2026, n. Consider all subsegments of this permutation containing an integer x. Given an integer m, we call the integer x good if there are exactly m different values of maximum on these subsegments. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). A sequence a is a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Given four integers n, m, k and p, write a function to count the number of permutations of length n with exactly k good numbers, modulo p. The function must receive four integers n, m, k and p and return an integer.", "response": "\ndef count_permutations(n, m, k, p):\n  \"\"\"Counts the number of permutations of length n with exactly k good numbers, modulo p.\"\"\"\n\n  # Create a list of all permutations of length n.\n  permutations = list(itertools.permutations(range(1, n + 1)))\n\n  # Count the number of good numbers in each permutation.\n  good_numbers = [0] * len(permutations)\n  for i, permutation in enumerate(permutations):\n    for j in range(len(permutation)):\n      # Find the maximum value in the subsegment of the permutation starting at index j.\n      max_value = max(permutation[j:])\n      # If the maximum value is x, then increment the count of good numbers for the permutation.\n      if permutation[j] == max_value:\n        good_numbers[i] += 1\n\n  # Count the number of permutations with exactly k good numbers.\n  count = 0\n  for i in range(len(permutations)):\n    if good_numbers[i] == k:\n      count += 1\n\n  # Return the count modulo p.\n  return count % p\n"}
