{"prompt": "For a given array a of length n, write a function to find all integers x >= 0 such that there exists an increasing subsequence of the array a, in which the bitwise XOR of numbers is equal to x. A sequence s is a subsequence of a sequence b if s can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. A sequence s1, s2, ..., sm is called increasing if s1 < s2 < ... < sm. The function must receive a list with n integers a1, a2, ..., an - the elements of the array a. The function must return a list of integers x1, x2, ..., xk, in increasing order - the found x values.", "response": "\ndef find_xor_subsequences(a):\n    # Initialize a set to store the found x values\n    x_values = set()\n\n    # Iterate over all the elements of the array\n    for i in range(len(a)):\n        # Initialize a set to store the XOR values of the subsequences ending at the current element\n        xor_values = set()\n\n        # Iterate over all the elements of the array up to the current element\n        for j in range(i):\n            # XOR the current element with the XOR value of the subsequence ending at the previous element\n            xor_values.add(a[i] ^ xor_values.pop())\n\n        # Add the XOR value of the subsequence ending at the current element to the set of found x values\n        x_values.update(xor_values)\n\n    # Return the list of found x values in increasing order\n    return sorted(list(x_values))\n"}
