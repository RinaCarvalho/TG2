{"prompt": "For a given array a of length n, write a function to find all integers x >= 0 such that there exists an increasing subsequence of the array a, in which the bitwise XOR of numbers is equal to x. A sequence s is a subsequence of a sequence b if s can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. A sequence s1, s2, ..., sm is called increasing if s1 < s2 < ... < sm. The function must receive a list with n integers a1, a2, ..., an - the elements of the array a. The function must return a list of integers x1, x2, ..., xk, in increasing order - the found x values.", "response": "\ndef find_xor_subsequences(a):\n  \"\"\"\n  Finds all integers x >= 0 such that there exists an increasing subsequence of the array a,\n  in which the bitwise XOR of numbers is equal to x.\n\n  Args:\n    a: A list of integers.\n\n  Returns:\n    A list of integers x1, x2, ..., xk, in increasing order - the found x values.\n  \"\"\"\n\n  # Initialize the set of found x values.\n  x = set()\n\n  # Iterate over all possible subsequences of a.\n  for i in range(1 << len(a)):\n    # Get the bitwise XOR of the current subsequence.\n    xor = 0\n    for j in range(len(a)):\n      if (i & (1 << j)) != 0:\n        xor ^= a[j]\n\n    # Add the current x value to the set of found x values.\n    x.add(xor)\n\n  # Return the list of found x values.\n  return sorted(list(x))\n\n\n# Test the function.\na = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(find_xor_subsequences(a))\n"}
