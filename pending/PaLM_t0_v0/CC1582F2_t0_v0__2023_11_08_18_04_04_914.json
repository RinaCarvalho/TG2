{"prompt": "For a given array a of length n, write a function to find all integers x >= 0 such that there exists an increasing subsequence of the array a, in which the bitwise XOR of numbers is equal to x. A sequence s is a subsequence of a sequence b if s can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. A sequence s1, s2, ..., sm is called increasing if s1 < s2 < ... < sm. The function must receive a list with n integers a1, a2, ..., an - the elements of the array a. The function must return a list of integers x1, x2, ..., xk, in increasing order - the found x values.", "response": "\ndef find_xor_subsequences(a):\n    n = len(a)\n    dp = [set() for _ in range(n)]\n    dp[0].add(a[0])\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        dp[i].add(a[i])\n        for j in range(i):\n            if a[i] > a[j]:\n                dp[i].update(dp[j].union({a[i] ^ x for x in dp[j]}))\n    return sorted(list(dp[n - 1]))\n\na = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(find_xor_subsequences(a))  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n"}
