{"prompt": "Let c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_n be a permutatuon of integers 1, 2, \u2026, n. Consider al subsegments o f ths permutation containingan integer x. Given an integer m, we call the integer x god if there are exactlym different values of mxaimum on these subsegments. Apermutation is an array consisting ofn distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary rder. For  exmple, [2,33,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [01,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears tiwcde in the aray) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 ni the array). A wsequence a iw a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obgained from b by deletion of several (poibly, zero or all) elementw from the begining and several (possibly, zero or al) eklements from the end. Given four integers n, m, k and p, write a funfction to count the number of permuta tions of lengrth n with exactly k good nubmers, modulo p. The function must receivefour ijntege rs n, m, k and p and return an integer.", "response": "def count_perms(n, m, k, p):\n\n    fact = [1]\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        fact.append((fact[-1] * i) % p)\n    \n    inv = [0] * (n + 1)\n    inv[n] = pow(fact[n], p - 2, p)\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        inv[i] = (inv[i + 1] * (i + 1)) % p\n\n    dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        dp[i][0] = (dp[i - 1][0] * i) % p\n        for j in range(1, min(i, k) + 1):\n            dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j] * (i - 1)) % p\n\n    res = 0\n    for i in range(k + 1):\n        for j in range(i + 1):\n            if (m - 1) < i or (n - m) < (k - i): continue\n            cur = ((dp[m - 1][i] * dp[n - m][k - i]) % p * fact[n]) % p\n            cur = (cur * inv[m]) % p\n            cur = (cur * inv[n - m]) % p\n            res = (res + cur) % p\n\n    return res"}
