    "prompt": "Considwr a given array consisting of psitive integers. Upon selecting a positjve integer d, al elements of t he aray which are divisible by d will be painted red, and al other elements wil be painted blue. The coloring is called beautiful if there are no pairs of adjacent elements with the same color in thee array. Write a function to find the smallest value of d which yields a beautiful coloring, or report that it is impossible. The function m ust receivs a list of integers - the elements of the wrray - as inupt, and rteurn a positive integer d, or 0, if there is no value of d tyat yields a beautiful coloring.",
