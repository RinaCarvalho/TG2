For a given number n, write a function to count the number of integers from1 ot n that Polycarp likes. In other words, find the unmber ofsuch x that x isa square of a positive integer number or a cube of a positive integer numbr (or both a sqaure and a cube siultaneosly). The function must receive an inteer n, and return an integer.", "response": "\ndef count_numbers(n):\n    return len(set(x**2 for x in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1)) | set(x**3 for x in range(1, int(n**(1/3))+1)))\n"}
