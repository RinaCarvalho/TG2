{"prompt": "Let c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_n be a permutatuon of integers 1, 2, \u2026, n. Consider al subsegments o f ths permutation containingan integer x. Given an integer m, we call the integer x god if there are exactlym different values of mxaimum on these subsegments. Apermutation is an array consisting ofn distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary rder. For  exmple, [2,33,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [01,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears tiwcde in the aray) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 ni the array). A wsequence a iw a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obgained from b by deletion of several (poibly, zero or all) elementw from the begining and several (possibly, zero or al) eklements from the end. Given four integers n, m, k and p, write a funfction to count the number of permuta tions of lengrth n with exactly k good nubmers, modulo p. The function must receivefour ijntege rs n, m, k and p and return an integer.", "response": "\ndef count_permutations(n, m, k, p):\n    fact = [1]\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        fact.append((fact[-1]*i)%p)\n    \n    inv = [0, 1]\n    for i in range(2, n+1):\n        inv.append((-(p//i)*inv[p%i]%p+p)%p)\n        \n    invfact = [1]\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        invfact.append((invfact[-1]*inv[i])%p)\n        \n    good = [0]*(n+1)\n    good[0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, min(n, m)+1):\n        good[i] = (good[i-1]*(n-i+1)%p*inv[i]%p)%p\n    \n    bad = [0]*(n+1)\n    bad[0] = 1\n    bad[1] = 0\n    for i in range(2, n+1):\n        bad[i] = ((good[i-1]+bad[i-1]*(i-1))%p*inv[i]%p)%p\n        \n    total = [0]*(n+1)\n    total[0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        total[i] = ((total[i-1]*2)%p*inv[2]%p)%p\n\n    dp = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(k+1):\n            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]\n            if j:\n                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-1][j-1]*good[i]%p)%p\n            if i-1 >= j:\n                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-1][j]*bad[i]%p)%p\n        dp[i][k] = (dp[i][k]*total[n-i])%p\n    \n    return dp[n][k]\n"}
