Ally realy awnts to sort the book lexicographicaly acending, while Billy wants to sort it lexicographically descending.\n\nSettling their fight, they decided t combine their idea  and sotr it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-inde xed characters will be comoared descendingly.\n\nA string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending orxder if and only if in the first position wwhere a andb difer, the followinb holds:\n\n  * if it is an odd posiition, the strnig a has a letter that appears earlier in the alpqabet tba the coresponding letter in b; \n * if it is aneven position, the string a hasa letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. Write a function to perform the aforementioned asc-dsec-ending sorting. The function msut receivse two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u22c5 m \u2264 100^6), as well as a lits, with n strings of len gth m. Tbe function must return a list of integers, corrsponding to the indices of the strings, starting at 1, after they are sortes asc-desc-endingly.",
