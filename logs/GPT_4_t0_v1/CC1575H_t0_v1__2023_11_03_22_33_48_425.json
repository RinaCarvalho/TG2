{"prompt": "The Winter holiday sill be here soon. Rm. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b lof length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k ocurrences of b as substrings im a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m+ 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be hanged such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s ocvurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly kdifferent pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q chracters from the end of t.Write a function to determine the minimum number of elemsents needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two bi nary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2)integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there ar e exactly k  occurrences of b as substrigns in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th itneger must be -1.", "response": "\ndef min_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    # Calculate prefix ones\n    pref = [0]*(n+1)\n    for i in range(1,n+1):\n        pref[i] = pref[i - 1] + (a[i - 1] == '1')\n\n    # Get b presence\n    bpres = [0]*(n - m + 2)\n    for i in range(m - 1, n):\n        if a[i - m + 1 : i + 1] == b:\n            bpres[i - m + 2] = 1\n\n    # Calculate prefix freq\n    psum = [0]*(n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        psum[i] = psum[i - 1] + bpres[i]\n\n    dp = [float('inf')] * (n - m + 2)\n    dp[0] = pref[m - 1] # Initialize dp[0] with number of 1's in first m bits of a.\n\n    for i in range(m,n + 1):\n        for k in range(psum[i], -1, -1):\n            if bpres[i]:\n                dp[k] = min(dp[k], dp[k - 1] if k else 0) + pref[i] - (pref[i - m] + bpres[i])             \n            if k < psum[i] + 1:\n                dp[k] = min(dp[k], dp[k] if k < psum[i] else float('inf')) + m - b.count('1') + pref[i] - pref[i - m]\n \n    # convert infinities to -1\n    dp = [-1 if x == float('inf') else x for x in dp]\n\n    return dp\n\na = '0110'\nb = '11'\nn = len(a)\nm = len(b)\n\nprint(min_changes(n, m, a, b))\n"}
