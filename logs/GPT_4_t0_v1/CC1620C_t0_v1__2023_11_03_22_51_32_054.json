{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a leter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the coresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-trings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.", "response": "def kth_lexi_smallest_BAstr(k, x, s):\n    dp = [0] * (k + 2)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] << 1\n\n    ans = \"\"\n    for c in s:\n        if c == 'a':\n            ans += 'a'\n        else:\n            while x < dp[k]:\n                k -= 1\n            ans += 'b' * (k + 1)\n            x -= dp[k]\n            if k >= 0: dp = dp[:k + 1] + [0] * (len(dp) - k - 1)\n\n    return ans if x <= 1 else ''"}
