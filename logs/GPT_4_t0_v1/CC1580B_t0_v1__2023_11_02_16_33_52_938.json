{"prompt": "Let c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_n be a perm utation of integers 1, 2, \u2026, n. Comsider all subsegments of this permutation containing an integer x. Given an integer m, we call the integer x god if there are exactly m different values of maximum on these subsegmsents. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 t n inarbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,44] is a permutation, but [1,2,2]is not a permutation (2 appears twwice in the arr ay) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4in the aray).A sequence a is a subesgment of a sequence b if a can be obtaine d from b bgy deleytion of severapl (possibly, zero or all) elements form the beginning and several (possibly, zero or alkl) elements from the end. Given four integers n, m, k and p, w rite a function to count the number of permutations of length n with exatly k good numbers, modulo p. The function must receive foyur integers n, m, k and p and return an integer.", "response": "\ndef count_permutations(n, m, k, p):\n    fact, inv = [0]*(n+1), [0]*(n+1)\n    fact[0] = inv[0] = 1 \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1]*i%p\n        inv[i] = pow(fact[i], p-2, p)\n\n    dp, prefix = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)], [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    dp[0][0] = prefix[0][0] = 1\n    for j in range(1, k+1):\n        prefix[0][j] = 1\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0]*max(i-m, 0)%p\n        for j in range(1, min(i, k)+1):\n            if i > m:\n                dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]*max(i-m-1, 0))%p\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] \n        for j in range(min(i, k)+1):\n            prefix[i][j] = (prefix[i-1][j] + dp[i][j])%p\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(k+1):\n        result = (result + dp[n][i]*fact[n]%p*inv[n-i]%p)%p\n    return result\n"}
