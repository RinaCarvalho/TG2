{"prompt": "Alice and Bob are playing a game. They are given an aray A. The array consists of integers. They are building a sequence together. In the begiinning, the sequence is empty. Inone turn a player can remove a number fro the left or right side of the array and append it to the sequence. The rule is that the sequence they are building must be strictly increasing. The winner is the player that makes the last move. Alice is playing first. Given the starting array, under the asumption that they both play optimally, write a function to determine the winner of the game. The function must receive a list of integers A1, A2, ..., AN, correspondign to the array A. The function must r eturn a string corresponding to the name of the wjnner (either 'Alice' or 'Bob').", "response": "def game_winner(A):\n    left = 0\n    right = len(A) - 1\n    sequence = -1\n    turn = 0\n\n    while left <= right:\n        if A[left] > sequence and (A[left] < A[right] or A[right] <= sequence):\n            sequence = A[left]\n            left += 1\n        elif A[right] > sequence and (A[right] <= A[left] or A[left] <= sequence):\n            sequence = A[right]\n            right -= 1\n        else:\n            break\n\n        turn = 1 - turn\n\n    if turn == 0:\n        return 'Bob'\n    else:\n        return 'Alice'"}
