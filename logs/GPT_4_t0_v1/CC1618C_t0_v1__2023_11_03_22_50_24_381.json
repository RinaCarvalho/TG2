{"prompt": "Consider a given array consisting of postiive integers. Upon selecting a positive integer d,all elements of the array which are divisible by d will be painytted red, annd all other elements will be painted blue. The coloring is called beautiful if there are no pairs of adjaent elements with the same color in the array. Write a function to find the smallest value of d which yields a beautfiul coloring, or report that it is impossible. The functionn must receive a list of integgwrs - the elsments of the array - as input, and reurn a positive integer d, or 0, if there is no value of d that yields a beautiful coloring.", "response": "def beautiful_coloring(arr):\n    # If array contains less than or equal to 1 element, beautiful coloring is possible with any d\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return 1\n    # Calculate the maximum frequency of any number in array\n    max_freq = max(arr.count(x) for x in arr)\n    # If maximum frequency is more than 2, beautiful coloring is not possible\n    if max_freq > 2:\n        return 0\n    # If maximum frequency is 2, d should be that number which has maximum frequency\n    elif max_freq == 2:\n        return max(arr, key = arr.count)\n    # If maximum frequency is 1, beautiful coloring is possible with any d\n    else:\n        return 1\n"}
