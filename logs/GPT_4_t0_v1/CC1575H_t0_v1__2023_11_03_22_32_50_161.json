{"prompt": "The Winter holiday sill be here soon. Rm. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b lof length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k ocurrences of b as substrings im a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m+ 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be hanged such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s ocvurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly kdifferent pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q chracters from the end of t.Write a function to determine the minimum number of elemsents needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two bi nary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2)integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there ar e exactly k  occurrences of b as substrigns in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th itneger must be -1.", "response": "\nfrom itertools import accumulate\n\ndef min_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    next, dp, sum_pref, pref, dp_sum = [0]*m, [0]*m, [0]*m, [0]*(n+1), [0]*(n+1)\n    \n    for i in range(m-2, -1, -1):\n        if b[i+1] == b[next[i+1]]:\n            next[i] = next[i+1]\n        else:\n            next[i] = i+1\n    \n    sum_pref[m-1] = sum(int(a[i])^int(b[i]) for i in range(m))\n    for i in range(m-2, -1, -1): \n        sum_pref[i] = sum_pref[i+1] + (int(a[i])^int(b[i]))\n\n    for i in range(m, n+1):\n        pref[i] = min(pref[i-1], sum_pref[0] + pref[i-m] + (int(a[i-1])^int(b[m-1])))\n        dp_sum[i] = min(dp_sum[i-1], sum_pref[next[0]] + dp_sum[i-next[0]]+(int(a[i-next[0]-1])^int(b[next[0]-1])) if next[0] != 0 else float('inf'))\n\n    return [min(pref[i], dp_sum[i] if i >= m else float('inf')) if i >= 0 else -1 for i in range(n-m+2)]\n"}
