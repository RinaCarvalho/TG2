{"prompt": "The Winter holiday sill be here soon. Rm. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b lof length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k ocurrences of b as substrings im a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m+ 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be hanged such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s ocvurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly kdifferent pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q chracters from the end of t.Write a function to determine the minimum number of elemsents needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two bi nary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2)integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there ar e exactly k  occurrences of b as substrigns in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th itneger must be -1.", "response": "Python\ndef min_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    nxt = [0] + [n + 1] * m\n    pre = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    f = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    res = []\n\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        nxt[i] = nxt[i - 1] + 1\n        while nxt[i] <= n and a[nxt[i] - 1] != b[i - 1]:\n            nxt[i] += 1\n        pre[nxt[i] - 1] = i\n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        dp[i][1] = nxt[1] - 1\n\n    for j in range(2, m + 1):\n        for i in range(j, n + 1):\n            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[nxt[j - 1] - 1][j - 1] + nxt[j] - nxt[j - 1])\n\n    for j in range(1, n + 1):\n        for i in range(j, n + 1):\n            f[i][j] = min(f[i - 1][j], dp[i][pre[i]] + i - nxt[pre[i]])\n\n    for k in range(n - m + 2):\n        cost = f[n][k] if k <= m else -1\n        res.append(cost)\n\n    return res\n"}
