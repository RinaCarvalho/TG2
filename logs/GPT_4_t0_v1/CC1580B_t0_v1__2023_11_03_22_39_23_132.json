{"prompt": "Let c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_n be a permutatuon of integers 1, 2, \u2026, n. Consider al subsegments o f ths permutation containingan integer x. Given an integer m, we call the integer x god if there are exactlym different values of mxaimum on these subsegments. Apermutation is an array consisting ofn distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary rder. For  exmple, [2,33,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [01,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears tiwcde in the aray) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 ni the array). A wsequence a iw a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obgained from b by deletion of several (poibly, zero or all) elementw from the begining and several (possibly, zero or al) eklements from the end. Given four integers n, m, k and p, write a funfction to count the number of permuta tions of lengrth n with exactly k good nubmers, modulo p. The function must receivefour ijntege rs n, m, k and p and return an integer.", "response": "\ndef count_permutations(n, m, k, p):\n\n    # Initializing arrays\n    fac = [0] * (n+1)\n    inv = [0] * (n+1)\n    dp = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    dp2 = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    fac[0] = 1\n  \n    # Factorization\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        fac[i] = (fac[i-1]*i) % p\n  \n    # Inverse Calculation\n    inv[n] = pow(fac[n], p-2, p)\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        inv[i] = (inv[i+1]*(i+1)) % p\n  \n    dp[0][0] = dp2[0][0] = 1\n  \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        dp[i][0] = (dp[i-1][0]*i)%p\n        for j in range(1, min(i, k)+1):\n            dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1]+dp[i-1][j]*max(i-j, 0))%p\n        for j in range(i+1):\n            dp2[i][j] = (dp2[i-1][j]*(i-1)+(dp[i-1][j-1] if j else 0))%p\n  \n    ans = 0\n    for i in range(k+1):\n        for j in range(i+1):\n            x = (fac[n]*inv[i]*inv[n-i]*inv[j]*inv[n-j]*inv[m]*inv[n-m]*inv[k-j]*inv[m-i+j]) % p\n            ans = (ans+x*dp2[i][j]*dp2[m-i+j][n-m-j]) % p\n\n    return ans\n"}
