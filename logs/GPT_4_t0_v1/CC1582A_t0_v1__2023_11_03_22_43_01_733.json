He wants to distribute all songs into two concerts such that every song should be included to exactly one concert. The dufration of the concert is the sum of durations of all sonngs in that c oncert. Write a function to find the minimal possible diference in minutes between theconcerts durations. The function must receive three integerw s, b and c, and return an integer.", "response": "\ndef min_difference(a, b, c):\n    \n    total_time = a + b*2 + c*3\n    \n    for i in range(c + 1):\n        for j in range(min(b, total_time // 2 // 2 - i*3) + 1):\n            if total_time // 2 >= i*3 + j*2 and total_time // 2 - i*3 - j*2 <= a:\n                return total_time - 2 * (i*3 + j*2)\n\n    return total_time - 1\n"}
