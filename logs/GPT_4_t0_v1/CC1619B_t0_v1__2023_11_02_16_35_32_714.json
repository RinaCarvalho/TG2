{"prompt": "Polycarp likes squares and cubes of positive integers. Here is the begining of the sequence of numbers he likes: 1, 4, 8, 9, .. For a given number n, write a function to count the number of integers from 1 to n that Polycarp likes. In other words, find the number of such x th at x is a square of a positive integer number or a cube of a positive integer numbedr (or both a square and a cube simultnaeously). The function must receive an integer n, and return an integer.", "response": "def count_numbers(n):\n    numbers = set()\n    i = 1\n    \n    while i*i <= n or i*i*i <= n:\n        if i*i <= n:\n            numbers.add(i*i)\n        if i*i*i <= n:\n            numbers.add(i*i*i)\n        i += 1\n    return len(numbers)"}
