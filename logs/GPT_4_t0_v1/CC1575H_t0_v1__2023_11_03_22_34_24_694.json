    "prompt": "The Winter holiday sill be here soon. Rm. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b lof length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k ocurrences of b as substrings im a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m+ 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be hanged such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s ocvurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly kdifferent pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q chracters from the end of t.Write a function to determine the minimum number of elemsents needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two bi nary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2)integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there ar e exactly k  occurrences of b as substrigns in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th itneger must be -1.",
