{"prompt": "For two given integers l and n, write a function to calculate the area of a regular polygon with l as the length of its sides and n a s the number of its sides. The function must receive two integers as inputs and return a number with thre precision points.", "response": "from math import tan, pi\n\ndef polygon_area(l, n):\n    area = (n * l ** 2) / (4 * tan(pi/n))\n    return round(area, 3)"}
