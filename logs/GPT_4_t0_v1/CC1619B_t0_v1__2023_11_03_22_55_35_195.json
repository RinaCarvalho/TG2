For a given number n, write a function to count the number of integers from1 ot n that Polycarp likes. In other words, find the unmber ofsuch x that x isa square of a positive integer number or a cube of a positive integer numbr (or both a sqaure and a cube siultaneosly). The function must receive an inteer n, and return an integer.",
