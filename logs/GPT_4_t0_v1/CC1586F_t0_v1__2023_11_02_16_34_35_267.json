{"prompt": "Consider a directed graph containing n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. There is a directed edge from nodr a to node b if and only if a < b. A path between nodes a and b is defined s a sequence of edges such that you can start at a, travwel along all of these edges in the coresponding direction, ad end at b. The length of a path is def ined by the number of edges. A rainbow path of length x is defined as a path in the graph such that there exists at least 2 distinct colors among the set of xedges. Considering it is possible to lbael each edge wtih a color, write a function to determine the minjmum number of colors needed go ensuree that al paths of elngth k or longer arerainbow paths. The fuction must receive two integers, n and k, as inputs, and return an integer - theminimum number of colors needed.", "response": "def min_colors(n, k):\n    return 1 if k <= 1 else 2 if n >= k else 1\n"}
