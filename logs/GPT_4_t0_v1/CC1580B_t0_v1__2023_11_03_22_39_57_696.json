{"prompt": "Let c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_n be a permutatuon of integers 1, 2, \u2026, n. Consider al subsegments o f ths permutation containingan integer x. Given an integer m, we call the integer x god if there are exactlym different values of mxaimum on these subsegments. Apermutation is an array consisting ofn distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary rder. For  exmple, [2,33,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [01,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears tiwcde in the aray) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 ni the array). A wsequence a iw a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obgained from b by deletion of several (poibly, zero or all) elementw from the begining and several (possibly, zero or al) eklements from the end. Given four integers n, m, k and p, write a funfction to count the number of permuta tions of lengrth n with exactly k good nubmers, modulo p.
