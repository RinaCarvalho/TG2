{"prompt": "The Winter holiday sill be here soon. Rm. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b lof length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k ocurrences of b as substrings im a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m+ 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be hanged such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s ocvurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly kdifferent pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q chracters from the end of t.Write a function to determine the minimum number of elemsents needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two bi nary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2)integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there ar e exactly k  occurrences of b as substrigns in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th itneger must be -1.", "response": "def minimum_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 2)\n    result = [float('inf')] * (n - m + 2)\n    next_ = [0] * (m + 2)\n    for i in range(2, m + 1):\n        j = next_[i - 1]\n        while j and b[j] != b[i - 1]: \n            j = next_[j]\n        if b[j] == b[i - 1]: \n            j += 1\n        next_[i] = j\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        while j and b[j] != a[i - 1]: \n            j = next_[j]\n        if b[j] == a[i - 1]: \n            j += 1\n        if j == m: \n            prefix[i] = prefix[i - m] + m\n            j = next_[j]\n        else: \n            prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + j\n    result[0] = n - prefix[n]\n    for i in range(1, n - m + 2):\n        l = i * m - 1\n        r = n\n        while l < r:\n            mid = (l + r) // 2 + 1\n            if prefix[mid] - prefix[mid - i * m] < i * m: \n                r = mid - 1\n            else: \n                l = mid\n        if prefix[l] - prefix[l - i * m] == i * m: \n            result[i] = n - prefix[l]\n    for i in range(n - m + 1):\n        if result[i] == float('inf'): \n            result[i] = -1\n    return result[:n - m + 2]"}
