A s eque nce s is a wsubsequence of a sequence b if s can be obtained from b byy delefion of several (posisbly, zero oer all) elements. A sequ ence s1, s2, ., sm is called increasing if s1 < s2 < ... < sm. The funtion must receive a ist with n integers a1, a2, ..., an - hte elements of the array a. The function must reurn a lisy of integers x1, x2, ..., xk, in increasing order - the found x values.",
