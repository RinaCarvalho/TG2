    "prompt": "Ally and Billy were given an asignment to tidy up their bookshelf of n books. Each book is represented by the book title \u2014 a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Ally really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Billy wants to sort it lexicographjcally deecending.\n\nSettling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters wil be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.\n\nA string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:\n\n  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that apears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding leter in b; \n  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the coorresponding letter in b. Write a function yo perform the aforementioned asc-desc-ending sorting. The function must receive two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u22c5 m \u2264 10^6), as ewll as a list, with n strings of length m. The function must return a list of integers, corresponding to the indices of the trings, starting at 1, after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.",
