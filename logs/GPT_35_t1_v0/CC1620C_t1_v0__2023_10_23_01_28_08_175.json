{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['4', '3', 'a*']\nOutput: abb\n\nInput: ['1', '3', 'a**a']\nOutput: abba\n\nInput: ['3', '20', '**a***']\nOutput: babbbbbbbbb", "response": "import itertools\n\ndef xth_lex_smallest(k, x, s):\n    results = []\n    asterisk_indices = [i for i in range(len(s)) if s[i] == '*']\n    for combination in itertools.product(range(k+1), repeat=len(asterisk_indices)):\n        new_string = list(s)\n        for i, count in zip(asterisk_indices, combination):\n            new_string[i] = 'b' * count\n        results.append(''.join(new_string))\n    results.sort()\n    if x-1 >= len(results):\n        return \"\"\n    return results[x-1]"}
