{"prompt": "For two given closed intervals, write a function to determine the intersection between them. The function must receive two tuples of two integers each as input and return a tuple of two integers, if the length of the intersection is larger than 1, or a single integer otherwise.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['(1, 3)', '(2, 4)']\nOutput: (2, 3)\n\nInput: ['(1, 2)', '(2, 3)']\nOutput: 2", "response": "def find_intersection(interval1, interval2):\n    start1, end1 = interval1\n    start2, end2 = interval2\n    intersection_start = max(start1, start2)\n    intersection_end = min(end1, end2)\n    if intersection_start < intersection_end:\n        return (intersection_start, intersection_end)\n    else:\n        return intersection_start"}
