{"prompt": "For two given strings, consisting only of 0s and 1s, write a function that performs binary XOR on the inputs. The function must receive two strings as inputs and return a string.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['010', '110']\nOutput: 100\n\nInput: ['1', '0']\nOutput: 1", "response": "def perform_binary_xor(input1: str, input2: str) -> str:\n    return bin(int(input1, 2) ^ int(input2, 2))[2:]"}
