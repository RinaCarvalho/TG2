{"prompt": "Polycarp likes squares and cubes of positive integers. Here is the beginning of the sequence of numbers he likes: 1, 4, 8, 9, .... For a given number n, write a function to count the number of integers from 1 to n that Polycarp likes. In other words, find the number of such x that x is a square of a positive integer number or a cube of a positive integer number (or both a square and a cube simultaneously). The function must receive an integer n, and return an integer.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: 10\nOutput: 4\n\nInput: 1\nOutput: 1\n\nInput: 25\nOutput: 6", "response": "import math\n\ndef count_polycarp_likes(n):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if math.sqrt(i).is_integer() or math.pow(i, 1/3).is_integer():\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\n# test cases\nprint(count_polycarp_likes(10))\nprint(count_polycarp_likes(1))\nprint(count_polycarp_likes(25))"}
