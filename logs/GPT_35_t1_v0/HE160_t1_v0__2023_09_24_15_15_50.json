{"prompt": "Given a list of integers and a list of operations, write a function that builds an algebraic expression by sequentially placing each operation in the list of operations between two integers in the list of integers, and calculates the result of this expression. The function must receive a list of integers and a list of strings and return an integer.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['[2, 3, 4, 5]', \"['+', '*', '-']\"]\nOutput: 9\n\nInput: ['[2, 3, 4, 5]', \"['**', '*', '+']\"]\nOutput: 37", "response": "def evaluate_expression(numbers, operations):\n    expression = \"\"\n    for i in range(len(numbers)-1):\n        expression += str(numbers[i]) + operations[i]\n    expression += str(numbers[-1])\n    result = eval(expression)\n    return result"}
