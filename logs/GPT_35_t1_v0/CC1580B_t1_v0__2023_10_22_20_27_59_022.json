{"prompt": "Let c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_n be a permutation of integers 1, 2, \u2026, n. Consider all subsegments of this permutation containing an integer x. Given an integer m, we call the integer x good if there are exactly m different values of maximum on these subsegments. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). A sequence a is a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Given four integers n, m, k and p, write a function to count the number of permutations of length n with exactly k good numbers, modulo p. The function must receive four integers n, m, k and p and return an integer.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['4', '3', '2', '10007']\nOutput: 4\n\nInput: ['6', '4', '1', '769626776']\nOutput: 472\n\nInput: ['66', '11', '9', '786747482']\nOutput: 206331312\n\nInput: ['99', '30', '18', '650457567']\nOutput: 77365367", "response": "def count_permutations(n, m, k, p):\n    def calculate_permutations(n, m):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            for j in range(i, n+1):\n                subsegment = permutation[i-1:j]\n                max_value = max(subsegment)\n                if subsegment.count(max_value) == m:\n                    count += 1\n        return count\n    \n    def get_permutations(n, k):\n        if k == 0:\n            return [[i] for i in range(1, n+1)]\n        else:\n            permutations = get_permutations(n, k-1)\n            new_permutations = []\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                for permutation in permutations:\n                    new_permutation = [i] + permutation\n                    new_permutations.append(new_permutation)\n            return new_permutations\n    \n    permutations = get_permutations(n, k)\n    count = 0\n    for permutation in permutations:\n        count += calculate_permutations(n, m)\n    return count % p"}
