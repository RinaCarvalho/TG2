{"prompt": "The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t. Write a function to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there are exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '100101011', '101']\nOutput: 1 1 0 1 6 -1 -1 -1\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '101101011', '111']\nOutput: 0 2 1 3 2 2 4 3", "response": "def min_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    counts = [0] * (n - m + 2)\n    for k in range(n - m + 2):\n        for p in range(n - m + 1):\n            s = a[p:p + m]\n            if s == b and p + m <= n and p + k * (m - 1) <= n:\n                counts[k] += sum(s[i] != a[p + i] for i in range(m))\n    return counts"}
