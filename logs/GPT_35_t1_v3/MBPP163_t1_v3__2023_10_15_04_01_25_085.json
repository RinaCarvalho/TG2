{"prompt": "For two given integers l and n, write a function to calculate the area of a regular polygon with l as the length of its sides and n as the number of its sides. The function must receive two integers as inputs and return a number with three precision points.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['20', '4']\nOutput: 400\n\nInput: ['15', '10']\nOutput: 1731.197", "response": "import math\n\ndef calculate_polygon_area(l, n):\n    side_length = int(l)\n    num_sides = int(n)\n    \n    apothem_length = side_length / (2 * math.tan(math.pi / num_sides))\n    area = (num_sides * side_length * apothem_length) / 2\n    \n    return round(area, 3)"}
