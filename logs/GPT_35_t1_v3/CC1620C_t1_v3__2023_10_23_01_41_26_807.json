{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: 4 3 a*\nOutput: abb\n\nInput: 1 3 a**a\nOutput: abba\n\nInput: 3 20 **a***\nOutput: babbbbbbbbb", "response": "def count_b(k, s):\n    count = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '*':\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef generate_ba_string(k, x):\n    ba_string = []\n    if k == 0:\n        ba_string.append('a')\n        return ''.join(ba_string)\n    \n    divisor = 1\n    while x > 0:\n        count = (x - 1) // (k ** count_b(k, s))\n        ba_string.append('a' * count)\n        if x % k != 0:\n            ba_string.append('b' * (x % k))\n        x -= count * (k ** count_b(k, s))\n        divisor *= k\n    return ''.join(ba_string[::-1])\n\nk, x, s = map(str, input().split())\nprint(generate_ba_string(int(k), int(x)))"}
