{"prompt": "For two given closed intervals, write a function to determine the intersection between them. The function must receive two tuples of two integers each as input and return a tuple of two integers, if the length of the intersection is larger than 1, or a single integer otherwise.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: [(1, 3), (2, 4)]\nOutput: '(2, 3)'\n\nInput: [(1, 2), (2, 3)]\nOutput: '2'", "response": "def intersection(interval1, interval2):\n    # Determine the start and end points of the intersection\n    start = max(interval1[0], interval2[0])\n    end = min(interval1[1], interval2[1])\n\n    # Check if there is an intersection\n    if start > end:\n        return None\n\n    # Determine the length of the intersection\n    length = end - start\n\n    # Return a tuple of two integers if the length is larger than 1,\n    # otherwise return a single integer\n    if length > 1:\n        return (start, end)\n    else:\n        return start"}
