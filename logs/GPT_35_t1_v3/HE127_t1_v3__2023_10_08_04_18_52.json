{"prompt": "For two given closed intervals, write a function to determine the intersection between them. The function must receive two tuples of two integers each as input and return a tuple of two integers, if the length of the intersection is larger than 1, or a single integer otherwise.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: [(1, 3), (2, 4)]\nOutput: '(2, 3)'\n\nInput: [(1, 2), (2, 3)]\nOutput: '2'", "response": "def interval_intersection(interval1, interval2):\n    intersection_start = max(interval1[0], interval2[0])\n    intersection_end = min(interval1[1], interval2[1])\n    \n    if intersection_end - intersection_start >= 1:\n        return (intersection_start, intersection_end)\n    else:\n        return intersection_start"}
