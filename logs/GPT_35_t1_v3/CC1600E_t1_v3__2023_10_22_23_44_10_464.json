{"prompt": "Alice and Bob are playing a game. They are given an array A. The array consists of integers. They are building a sequence together. In the beginning, the sequence is empty. In one turn a player can remove a number from the left or right side of the array and append it to the sequence. The rule is that the sequence they are building must be strictly increasing. The winner is the player that makes the last move. Alice is playing first. Given the starting array, under the assumption that they both play optimally, write a function to determine the winner of the game. The function must receive a list of integers A1, A2, ..., AN, corresponding to the array A. The function must return a string corresponding to the name of the winner (either 'Alice' or 'Bob').\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: 5\nOutput: Alice\n\nInput: 5 4 5\nOutput: Alice", "response": "def winner_of_game(A):\n    # convert the list of integers to a tuple\n    A = tuple(A)\n    \n    # initialize a dictionary to store the previous results\n    # where the key is the tuple A and the value is the name of the winner\n    memo = {}\n    \n    # recursive helper function to determine the winner of the game\n    def play_game(A):\n        # if the array A is already empty, Alice cannot make a move and Bob wins\n        if len(A) == 0:\n            return 'Bob'\n        \n        # if the result for the current array A is already memoized, return the result\n        if A in memo:\n            return memo[A]\n        \n        # Alice's turn\n        if len(A) % 2 == 1:\n            # if Alice can remove the leftmost element and still create a strictly increasing sequence, she wins\n            if A[0] < A[-1]:\n                result = play_game(A[1:])            \n            # if Alice can remove the rightmost element and still create a strictly increasing sequence, she wins\n            elif A[0] > A[-1]:\n                result = play_game(A[:-1])\n            # if Alice cannot create a strictly increasing sequence by removing either side, she loses\n            else:\n                result = 'Bob'\n                \n        # Bob's turn\n        else:\n            # if Bob can remove the leftmost element and still create a strictly increasing sequence, he wins\n            if A[0] < A[-1]:\n                result = play_game(A[1:])            \n            # if Bob can remove the rightmost element and still create a strictly increasing sequence, he wins\n            elif A[0] > A[-1]:\n                result = play_game(A[:-1])\n            # if Bob cannot create a strictly increasing sequence by removing either side, he loses\n            else:\n                result = 'Alice'\n        \n        # memoize the result for the current array A\n        memo[A] = result\n        \n        # return the result\n        return result\n    \n    # start the game with the initial array A\n    return play_game(A)"}
