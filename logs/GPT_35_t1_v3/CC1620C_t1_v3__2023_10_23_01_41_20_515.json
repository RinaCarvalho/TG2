    "prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: 4 3 a*\nOutput: abb\n\nInput: 1 3 a**a\nOutput: abba\n\nInput: 3 20 **a***\nOutput: babbbbbbbbb",
