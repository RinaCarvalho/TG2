{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: 4 3 a*\nOutput: abb\n\nInput: 1 3 a**a\nOutput: abba\n\nInput: 3 20 **a***\nOutput: babbbbbbbbb", "response": "\ndef generate_ba_string(k, x, s):\n    count = 0\n    ba_strings = set()\n\n    def backtrack(curr_string):\n        nonlocal count\n\n        if len(curr_string) == len(s):\n            ba_strings.add(curr_string)\n            count += 1\n            return\n\n        if s[len(curr_string)] == '*':\n            for i in range(k+1):\n                temp_string = curr_string + 'b'*i\n                backtrack(temp_string)\n        else:\n            temp_string = curr_string + s[len(curr_string)]\n            backtrack(temp_string)\n\n    backtrack('')\n    ba_strings = sorted(ba_strings)\n    return ba_strings[x-1]\n\nk = 4\nx = 3\ns = 'a*'\nprint(generate_ba_string(k, x, s))\n\nk = 1\nx = 3\ns = 'a**a'\nprint(generate_ba_string(k, x, s))\n\nk = 3\nx = 20\ns = '**a***'\nprint(generate_ba_string(k, x, s))\n"}
