    "prompt": "For a given list of strings, the 'asc-desc-ending' sort is defined as a sorting strategy in which a string 'a' occurs before a string 'b' if and only if in the first position where 'a' and 'b' differ, the following holds: if the position has an odd index, the letter in 'a' must appaear earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in 'b'; if the position has an even index, the letter in 'b' must appear earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in 'a'. Write a function to perform 'asc-desc-ending' sorting. The function must receive two integers n and m, as well as a list, with n strings of length m. The function must return a list of integers, corresponing to the indices of the strings, starting at 1, after they are sorted.",
