{"prompt": "Let c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_n be a permutation of integers 1, 2, \u2026, n. Consider all subsegments of this permutation containing an integer x. Given an integer m, we call the integer x good if there are exactly m different values of maximum on these subsegments. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). A sequence a is a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Given four integers n, m, k and p, write a function to count the number of permutations of length n with exactly k good numbers, modulo p. The function must receive four integers n, m, k and p and return an integer.", "response": "\ndef count_good_permutations(n, m, k, p):\n    # Create a list of all permutations of length n\n    permutations = list(itertools.permutations(range(1, n + 1)))\n\n    # Count the number of good permutations\n    good_permutations = 0\n    for permutation in permutations:\n        # Count the number of good numbers in the permutation\n        good_numbers = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Find the maximum value in the subsegment of the permutation starting at i\n            max_value = max(permutation[i:])\n\n            # If the maximum value occurs exactly m times in the subsegment, then the number is good\n            if permutation[i:].count(max_value) == m:\n                good_numbers += 1\n\n        # If the number of good numbers is equal to k, then the permutation is good\n        if good_numbers == k:\n            good_permutations += 1\n\n    # Return the number of good permutations modulo p\n    return good_permutations % p\n"}
