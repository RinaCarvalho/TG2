{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.", "response": "\ndef generate_ba_strings(k, x, s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\n    Args:\n        k (int): The maximum number of 'b's that can replace an asterisk.\n        x (int): The index of the lexicographically smallest BA-string to find.\n        s (str): The string consisting only of characters 'a' and '*'.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize the list of BA-strings.\n    ba_strings = []\n\n    # Generate all possible BA-strings.\n    for i in range(k + 1):\n        ba_strings.append(s.replace(\"*\", \"b\" * i))\n\n    # Sort the BA-strings lexicographically.\n    ba_strings.sort()\n\n    # Return the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n    return ba_strings[x - 1]\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    k = int(input())\n    x = int(input())\n    s = input()\n\n    print(generate_ba_strings(k, x, s))\n"}
