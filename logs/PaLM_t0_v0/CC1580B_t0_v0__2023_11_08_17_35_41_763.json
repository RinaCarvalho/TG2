{"prompt": "Let c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_n be a permutation of integers 1, 2, \u2026, n. Consider all subsegments of this permutation containing an integer x. Given an integer m, we call the integer x good if there are exactly m different values of maximum on these subsegments. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). A sequence a is a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Given four integers n, m, k and p, write a function to count the number of permutations of length n with exactly k good numbers, modulo p. The function must receive four integers n, m, k and p and return an integer.", "response": "\ndef count_good_permutations(n, m, k, p):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of permutations of length n with exactly k good numbers, modulo p.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The length of the permutation.\n        m (int): The number of different values of maximum on the subsegments.\n        k (int): The number of good numbers in the permutation.\n        p (int): The modulus.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of permutations of length n with exactly k good numbers, modulo p.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize the dp table.\n    dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n\n    # Base case: There are no good numbers in the permutation.\n    dp[0][0] = 1\n\n    # Iterate over the length of the permutation.\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Iterate over the number of good numbers in the permutation.\n        for j in range(k + 1):\n            # If the current number is good, then there are two possibilities:\n            # 1.
