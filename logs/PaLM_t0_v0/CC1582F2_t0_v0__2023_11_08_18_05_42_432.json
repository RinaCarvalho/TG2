{"prompt": "For a given array a of length n, write a function to find all integers x >= 0 such that there exists an increasing subsequence of the array a, in which the bitwise XOR of numbers is equal to x. A sequence s is a subsequence of a sequence b if s can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. A sequence s1, s2, ..., sm is called increasing if s1 < s2 < ... < sm. The function must receive a list with n integers a1, a2, ..., an - the elements of the array a. The function must return a list of integers x1, x2, ..., xk, in increasing order - the found x values.", "response": "\ndef find_xor_subsequences(a):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find all integers x >= 0 such that there exists an increasing subsequence of the array a,\n    in which the bitwise XOR of numbers is equal to x.\n\n    Args:\n        a (list): The array of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of integers x1, x2, ..., xk, in increasing order - the found x values.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize the set of found x values.\n    x_values = set()\n\n    # Iterate over all possible subsequences of the array.\n    for i in range(1 << len(a)):\n        # Get the bitwise XOR of the current subsequence.\n        x = 0\n        for j in range(len(a)):\n            if (i >> j) & 1:\n                x ^= a[j]\n\n        # Add the current x value to the set of found x values.\n        x_values.add(x)\n\n    # Return the list of found x values in increasing order.\n    return sorted(list(x_values))\n"}
