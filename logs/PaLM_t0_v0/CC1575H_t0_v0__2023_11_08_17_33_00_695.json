{"prompt": "The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t. Write a function to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there are exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.", "response": "\ndef min_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k.\n\n    Args:\n    n: The length of the string a.\n    m: The length of the string b.\n    a: The binary string a.\n    b: The binary string b.\n\n    Returns:\n    A list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of \n    elements in a that must be changed so there are exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. \n    If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize the dp table.\n    dp = [[-1] * (n - m + 2) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n\n    # Fill the dp table.\n    for i in range(m + 1):\n        for j in range(n - m + 2):\n            if i == 0:\n                dp[i][j] = j\n            elif j == 0:\n                dp[i][j] = i\n            else:\n                if a[j - 1] == b[i - 1]:\n                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]\n                else:\n                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j - 1], dp[i][j - 1]) + 1\n\n    # Return the result.\n    return dp[m]\n"}
