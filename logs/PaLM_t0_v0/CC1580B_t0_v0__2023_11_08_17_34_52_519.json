{"prompt": "Let c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_n be a permutation of integers 1, 2, \u2026, n. Consider all subsegments of this permutation containing an integer x. Given an integer m, we call the integer x good if there are exactly m different values of maximum on these subsegments. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). A sequence a is a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Given four integers n, m, k and p, write a function to count the number of permutations of length n with exactly k good numbers, modulo p. The function must receive four integers n, m, k and p and return an integer.", "response": "\ndef count_permutations(n, m, k, p):\n    \"\"\"Counts the number of permutations of length n with exactly k good numbers, modulo p.\"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize the dp table.\n    dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n\n    # Fill in the base cases.\n    for i in range(n + 1):\n        dp[i][0] = 1\n\n    # Iterate over the length of the permutation.\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Iterate over the number of good numbers.\n        for j in range(1, k + 1):\n            # Iterate over the last element of the permutation.\n            for x in range(1, i + 1):\n                # Count the number of good numbers in the subsegments containing x.\n                good_count = 0\n                for l in range(1, i + 1):\n                    if dp[l][j - 1] > 0 and max(dp[l][j - 1]) == x:\n                        good_count += 1\n                # Update the dp table.\n                dp[i][j] += good_count % p\n\n    # Return the number of permutations with exactly k good numbers.\n    return dp[n][k] % p\n"}
