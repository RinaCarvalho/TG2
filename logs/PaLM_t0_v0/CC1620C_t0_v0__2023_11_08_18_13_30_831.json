{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.", "response": "\ndef generate_ba_strings(k, x, s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\n    Args:\n        k (int): The maximum number of 'b's that can replace an asterisk.\n        x (int): The index of the lexicographically smallest BA-string to generate.\n        s (str): The string consisting of 'a's and '*''s.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize the BA-string.\n    ba_string = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over the characters in the string.\n    for char in s:\n        # If the character is an asterisk, replace it with the lexicographically smallest\n        # possible string of 'b's.\n        if char == \"*\":\n            ba_string += \"b\" * (k - len(ba_string))\n        # Otherwise, add the character to the BA-string.\n        else:\n            ba_string += char\n\n    # Return the BA-string.\n    return ba_string\n\n\n# Get the input.\nk = int(input())\nx = int(input())\ns = input()\n\n# Generate the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\nba_string = generate_ba_strings(k, x, s)\n\n# Print the BA-string.\nprint(ba_string)\n"}
