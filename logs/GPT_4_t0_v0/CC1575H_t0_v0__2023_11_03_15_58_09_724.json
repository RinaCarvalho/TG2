{"prompt": "The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t. Write a function to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there are exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.", "response": "\ndef min_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    counts = [0 for _ in range(n - m + 2)]\n    matches = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    pattern_sum = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    res = [float('inf') for _ in range(len(counts))]\n\n    for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):\n        if b[i] == '1':\n            counts[1] += 1\n\n    for i in range(n - m, -1, -1):\n        matches[i] = matches[i + 1]\n        if a[i:i + m] == b:\n            matches[i] += 1\n\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        pattern_sum[i] = pattern_sum[i + 1]\n        diff_score = counts[1] - 2 * sum(int(a[i + j]) == int(b[j]) for j in range(m))\n        pattern_sum[i] += diff_score\n\n    for i in range(n - m + 1):\n        res[matches[i]] = min(res[matches[i]], pattern_sum[i])\n\n    for i in range(n - m, -1, -1):\n        res[i] = min(res[i], res[i + 1])\n\n    res = res[:-1]\n    for i in range(len(res)):\n        if res[i] == float('inf'):\n            res[i] = -1\n\n    return res\n"}
