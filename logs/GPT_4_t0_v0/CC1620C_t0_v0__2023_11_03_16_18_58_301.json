{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.", "response": "\ndef xth_lex_smallest_BAstr(k, x, s):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\"\"\"\n    a_count = s.count('a')\n    length = len(s)\n    dp = [[0]*(a_count+1) for _ in range(length+1)]\n    ans = ''\n\n    for i in range(length+1):\n        dp[i][0] = (k+1)**i\n\n    for i in range(1, length+1):\n        for j in range(1, a_count+1):\n            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + (k+1)*(dp[i-1][j])\n\n    curr_len = length\n    curr_a_count = a_count\n\n    while curr_len > 0:\n        if curr_a_count > 0 and dp[curr_len-1][curr_a_count-1] >= x:\n            ans += 'a'\n            curr_a_count -= 1\n        else:\n            ans += 'b'\n            if curr_a_count > 0:\n                x -= dp[curr_len-1][curr_a_count-1]\n            x = (x-1)//k+1\n        curr_len -= 1\n\n    return ans\n"}
