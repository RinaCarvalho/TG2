{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.", "response": "\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef nth_lexico_BA_string(k, x, s):\n    possible_combinations = list(product(range(k + 1), repeat=s.count('*')))\n    ba_strings = []\n    \n    for combination in possible_combinations:\n        string = \"\"\n        j = 0\n        \n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            if s[i] == '*':\n                string += 'b' * combination[j]\n                j += 1\n                \n            else:\n                string += s[i]\n                \n        ba_strings.append(string)\n    \n    ba_strings.sort()\n    return ba_strings[x - 1]\n"}
