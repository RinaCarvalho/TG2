{"prompt": "The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t. Write a function to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there are exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.", "response": "def count_substrings(a, b):\n    b_len = len(b)\n    a_len = len(a)\n    counts = [0] * (a_len + 1)\n\n    for i in range(0, a_len - b_len + 1):\n        counts[i] = sum([1 for j in range(b_len) if a[i+j] != b[j]])\n\n    return counts\n\ndef min_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    counts = count_substrings(a, b)\n    result = [-1] * (n - m + 2)\n\n    for k in range(n - m + 1):\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            total += counts[i]\n        for i in range(k, n - m + 1):\n            total += counts[i]\n            result[k+1] = min(result[k+1], total) if result[k+1] != -1 else total\n\n    return result[1:]"}
