{"prompt": "The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t. Write a function to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there are exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.", "response": "\ndef min_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    dp = [[0]*m for _ in range(n)]\n    sp = [[0]*m for _ in range(n)]\n    ans = [float('inf')]*(n - m + 2)\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        for j in range(min(i+1, m-1), -1, -1):\n            dp[i][j] = (a[i] != b[j]) + (dp[i+1][j+1] if i+1<n and j+1<m else 0)\n            sp[i][j] = min(sp[i+1][j] if i+1<n else 0, dp[i][j] + (sp[i+m][0] if i+m<n else 0))\n        if i + m <= n:\n            ans[i+m-n] = min(ans[i+m-n], sp[i][0] if i+m<=n else 0)\n\n    for k in range(n - m, -1, -1):\n        ans[k] = min(ans[k], ans[k+1])\n    result = [-1 if x == float('inf') else x for x in ans]\n    return result[:(n - m + 2)]\n"}
