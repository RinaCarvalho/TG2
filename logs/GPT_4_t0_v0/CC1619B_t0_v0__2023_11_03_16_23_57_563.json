{"prompt": "Polycarp likes squares and cubes of positive integers. Here is the beginning of the sequence of numbers he likes: 1, 4, 8, 9, .... For a given number n, write a function to count the number of integers from 1 to n that Polycarp likes. In other words, find the number of such x that x is a square of a positive integer number or a cube of a positive integer number (or both a square and a cube simultaneously). The function must receive an integer n, and return an integer.", "response": "def polycarp_numbers(n):\n    squares_cubes = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):\n        squares_cubes.add(i**2)\n        if i**3 <= n:\n            squares_cubes.add(i**3)\n    return len(squares_cubes)"}
