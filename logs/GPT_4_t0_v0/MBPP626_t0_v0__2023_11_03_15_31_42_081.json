{"prompt": "For a given number r, write a function to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with radius r. The function must receive a number r and return a number, or None.", "response": "def area_of_inscribed_triangle(r):\n    if r is None or r <= 0:\n        return None\n    else:\n        return 0.5 * (2*r) * r\n\n# The largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle is a right triangle\n# with base equal to the diameter of the semicircle and height equal to the radius.\n# Therefore, the area of this triangle is 1/2 * base * height or 1/2 * 2r * r."}
