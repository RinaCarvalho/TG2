{"prompt": "Polycarp likes squares and cubes of positive integers. Here is the beginning of the sequence of numbers he likes: 1, 4, 8, 9, .... For a given number n, write a function to count the number of integers from 1 to n that Polycarp likes. In other words, find the number of such x that x is a square of a positive integer number or a cube of a positive integer number (or both a square and a cube simultaneously). The function must receive an integer n, and return an integer.", "response": "def count_squares_and_cubes(n):\n    count = 0\n    i = 1\n    while i**2 <= n or i**3 <= n:\n        if i**2 <= n:\n            count += 1\n        if i**3 <= n and i**3 != i**2:\n            count += 1\n        i += 1\n    return count"}
