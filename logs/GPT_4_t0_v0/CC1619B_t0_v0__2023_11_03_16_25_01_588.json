    "prompt": "Polycarp likes squares and cubes of positive integers. Here is the beginning of the sequence of numbers he likes: 1, 4, 8, 9, .... For a given number n, write a function to count the number of integers from 1 to n that Polycarp likes. In other words, find the number of such x that x is a square of a positive integer number or a cube of a positive integer number (or both a square and a cube simultaneously). The function must receive an integer n, and return an integer.",
    "response": "def count_numbers(n):\n    square_n = int(n**0.5)\n    cube_n = int(n**(1/3))\n    return len({i**2 for i in range(1, square_n+1)} | {i**3 for i in range(1, cube_n+1)})",
