{"prompt": "For a given array a of length n, write a function to find all integers x >= 0 such that there exists an increasing subsequence of the array a, in which the bitwise XOR of numbers is equal to x. A sequence s is a subsequence of a sequence b if s can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. A sequence s1, s2, ..., sm is called increasing if s1 < s2 < ... < sm. The function must receive a list with n integers a1, a2, ..., an - the elements of the array a. The function must return a list of integers x1, x2, ..., xk, in increasing order - the found x values.", "response": "def find_subsequence_xors(a):\n    import itertools\n    n = len(a)\n    xor_values = []\n\n    for r in range(n + 1):  \n        combinations = list(itertools.combinations(a, r))\n        \n        for combination in combinations:  \n            xor = 0\n            is_increasing_sequence = True\n            \n            for i in range(len(combination)):\n                xor ^= combination[i]\n                if i > 0 and combination[i-1] >= combination[i]:\n                    is_increasing_sequence = False\n                    break\n                \n            if is_increasing_sequence:\n                xor_values.append(xor)\n\n    return sorted(list(set(xor_values)))"}
