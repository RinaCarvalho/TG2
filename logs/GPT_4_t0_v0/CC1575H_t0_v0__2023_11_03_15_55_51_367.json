{"prompt": "The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t. Write a function to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there are exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.", "response": "def min_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    results = [0] * (n - m + 2)\n    prefix = [0] * m\n    overlap = [0] * m\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    inf = n + 1\n    for i in range(m):\n        prefix[i] = sum(c1 != c2 for c1, c2 in zip(b[:i + 1], b))\n        overlap[i] = sum(c1 != c2 for c1, c2 in zip(b[:i + 1], b[1:]))\n    dp[0] = sum(c1 != c2 for c1, c2 in zip(a, b))\n    for i in range(1, n - m + 1):\n        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (a[i - 1] != a[i + m - 1]) - prefix[min(i - 1, m - 2)]\n    for i in range(n - m + 1, n + 1):\n        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] - overlap[min(i - m, m - 2)]\n    dp = [inf if j < 0 else j for j in dp]\n    dp.sort()\n    dp = dp + [inf]\n    count = dp[0]\n    ans = 0\n    while ans <= n - m + 1:\n        if count < inf:\n            results[ans] = count\n        count += dp[ans + 1] - dp[ans]\n        ans += 1\n    for k in range(ans, n - m + 2):\n        results[k] = -1\n    return results"}
