    "prompt": "Let c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_n be a permutation of integers 1, 2, \u2026, n. Consider all subsegments of this permutation containing an integer x. Given an integer m, we call the integer x good if there are exactly m different values of maximum on these subsegments. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). A sequence a is a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Given four integers n, m, k and p, write a function to count the number of permutations of length n with exactly k good numbers, modulo p. The function must receive four integers n, m, k and p and return an integer.",
