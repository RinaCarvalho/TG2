{"prompt": "For a given array a of length n, write a function to find all integers x >= 0 such that there exists an increasing subsequence of the array a, in which the bitwise XOR of numbers is equal to x. A sequence s is a subsequence of a sequence b if s can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. A sequence s1, s2, ..., sm is called increasing if s1 < s2 < ... < sm. The function must receive a list with n integers a1, a2, ..., an - the elements of the array a. The function must return a list of integers x1, x2, ..., xk, in increasing order - the found x values.", "response": "def findXOR(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    s = 1 << n\n    ans = set()\n    for i in range(1, s):\n        xor_val = 0\n        seq = []\n        for j in range(n):\n            if (i & (1 << j)):\n                if len(seq) > 0 and seq[-1] >= arr[j]:\n                    seq = []\n                    break\n                seq.append(arr[j])\n                xor_val ^= arr[j]\n        if seq:  \n            ans.add(xor_val)\n    return sorted(list(ans))"}
