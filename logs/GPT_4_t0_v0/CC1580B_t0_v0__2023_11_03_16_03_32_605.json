{"prompt": "Let c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_n be a permutation of integers 1, 2, \u2026, n. Consider all subsegments of this permutation containing an integer x. Given an integer m, we call the integer x good if there are exactly m different values of maximum on these subsegments. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). A sequence a is a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Given four integers n, m, k and p, write a function to count the number of permutations of length n with exactly k good numbers, modulo p. The function must receive four integers n, m, k and p and return an integer.", "response": "def count_permutations(n, m, k, p):\n    factorial = [1]\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        factorial.append((factorial[-1]*i)%p)\n        \n    inverse = [0, 1]\n    for i in range(2, n+1):\n        inverse.append((inverse[p%i]*(p-p//i))%p)\n        \n    C = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for i in range(n+1):\n        C[i][0] = 1\n        for j in range(1, min(i+1, n+1)):\n            C[i][j] = (C[i-1][j-1] + C[i-1][j])%p\n\n    dp = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 1 \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(k+1):\n            for t in range(min(j, i-1, m-1)+1):\n                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-1][j-t]*C[i-1][t]%p*C[n-i+1][m-t]%p*factorial[m]%p*inverse[m-t]%p)%p\n            if i <= n-1 and j-m >= 0: \n                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-1][j-m]*C[i-1][m-1]%p*C[n-i][m]%p*factorial[m]%p*inverse[m]%p)%p\n\n    return dp[n][k]"}
