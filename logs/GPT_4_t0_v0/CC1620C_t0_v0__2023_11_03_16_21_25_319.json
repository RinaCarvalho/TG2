{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.", "response": "\ndef getXthLexicographicallySmallestBAString(k, x, s):\n    dp = [[0 for _ in range(len(s) + 1)] for _ in range(len(s) + 1)]\n    dp[len(s)][0] = 1\n    for i in range(len(s), -1, -1):\n        for j in range(k, -1, -1):\n            if i < len(s):\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]\n                if s[i] == '*' and j < k:\n                    dp[i][j] += dp[i][j + 1]\n    baString = \"\"\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if s[i] == 'a' or (s[i] == '*' and x > dp[i + 1][j]):\n            if s[i] == '*':\n                x -= dp[i + 1][j]\n                j += 1\n            baString += 'b' * j\n            j = 0\n            if s[i] == 'a':\n                baString += 'a'\n    return baString + 'b' * j\n"}
