{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.", "response": "def BA_String(k, x, s):\n    if x == 1:\n        return s.replace('*', '')\n\n    s_count = s.count(\"*\")\n\n    ranked_b_strings = sorted(['b'*i for i in range(k+1)], key = len)\n    b_string_len = len(ranked_b_strings)\n\n    for i in range(s_count):\n        s = s.replace('*', ranked_b_strings[(x-1) // (b_string_len ** (s_count-i-1)) % b_string_len], 1)\n    \n    return s\n"}
