    "prompt": "Polycarp likes squares and cubes of positive integers. Here is the beginning of the sequence of numbers he likes: 1, 4, 8, 9, .... For a given number n, write a function to count the number of integers from 1 to n that Polycarp likes. In other words, find the number of such x that x is a square of a positive integer number or a cube of a positive integer number (or both a square and a cube simultaneously). The function must receive an integer n, and return an integer.",
    "response": "def polycarp_likes(n):\n    from math import sqrt, pow\n\n    square_root = int(sqrt(n))\n    cube_root = int(pow(n, 1/3))\n\n    return square_root + cube_root - int(sqrt(cube_root))",
