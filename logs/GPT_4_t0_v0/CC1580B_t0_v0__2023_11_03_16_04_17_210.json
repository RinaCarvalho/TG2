{"prompt": "Let c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_n be a permutation of integers 1, 2, \u2026, n. Consider all subsegments of this permutation containing an integer x. Given an integer m, we call the integer x good if there are exactly m different values of maximum on these subsegments. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). A sequence a is a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Given four integers n, m, k and p, write a function to count the number of permutations of length n with exactly k good numbers, modulo p. The function must receive four integers n, m, k and p and return an integer.", "response": "\ndef count_permutations(n, m, k, p):\n\n    fact = [1]\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        fact.append((fact[-1] * i) % p)\n\n    invfact = [1]\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        invfact.append(pow(fact[i], p - 2, p))\n\n    dp = [[[0 for _ in range(k+1)] for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for i in range(n+1):\n        dp[i][0][0] = 1\n\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        dp[i][0][0] = (dp[i-1][0][0] * fact[n-i]) % p\n        for j in range(1, min(i+1, n+1)):\n            dp[i][j][0] = (dp[i-1][j][0] * fact[n-i]) % p\n            dp[i][j][0] = (dp[i][j][0] + dp[i-1][j-1] * fact[n-i+1] % p * fact[j-1] % p * pow(j, i-j, p)) % p\n\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(n+1):\n            for l in range(1, k+1):\n                if l > j:\n                    continue\n                dp[i][j][l] = (dp[i][j][l] + dp[i-1][j][l] * fact[n-i] % p * invfact[j]) % p\n                dp[i][j][l] = (dp[i][j][l] + dp[i-1][j-1][l-1] * fact[n-i+1] % p * fact[j-1] % p * pow(j, i-j, p)) % p\n                if j > l:\n                    dp[i][j][l] = (dp[i][j][l] + dp[i-1][j-1][l] * fact[n-i] % p * fact[j-1] % p * pow(j-1, i-j, p)) % p\n\n    return dp[n][m][k]\n"}
