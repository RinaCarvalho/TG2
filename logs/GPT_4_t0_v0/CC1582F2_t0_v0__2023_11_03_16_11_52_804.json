{"prompt": "For a given array a of length n, write a function to find all integers x >= 0 such that there exists an increasing subsequence of the array a, in which the bitwise XOR of numbers is equal to x. A sequence s is a subsequence of a sequence b if s can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. A sequence s1, s2, ..., sm is called increasing if s1 < s2 < ... < sm. The function must receive a list with n integers a1, a2, ..., an - the elements of the array a. The function must return a list of integers x1, x2, ..., xk, in increasing order - the found x values.", "response": "def find_xor_subsequences(a):\n    n = len(a)\n    subseq_xor = set(a)\n    for i in range(n):\n        new_subseqs = {a[i]} \n        for xor in subseq_xor:\n            new_subseqs.add(xor | a[i])\n        subseq_xor = subseq_xor.union(new_subseqs)\n    return sorted(list(subseq_xor))"}
