{"prompt": "Let c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_n be a permutation of integers 1, 2, \u2026, n. Consider all subsegments of this permutation containing an integer x. Given an integer m, we call the integer x good if there are exactly m different values of maximum on these subsegments. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). A sequence a is a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Given four integers n, m, k and p, write a function to count the number of permutations of length n with exactly k good numbers, modulo p. The function must receive four integers n, m, k and p and return an integer.", "response": "\ndef count_permutations(n, m, k, p):\n    dp = [[[0 for _ in range(m+1)] for _ in range(k+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    comb = [[0 for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    sum_dp = [[0 for _ in range(m+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    dp[0][0][0] = comb[0][0] = sum_dp[0][0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        comb[i][0] = 1\n        for j in range(1, i+1):\n            comb[i][j] = (comb[i-1][j-1] + comb[i-1][j]) % p\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        dp[i][1][1] = dp[i-1][0][0]\n        for j in range(2, m+1):\n            dp[i][j][1] = sum_dp[i-1][j-1]\n        for j in range(i, 1, -1):\n            dp[i][1][j] = (dp[i][1][j] + dp[i-1][j-1][1]) % p\n        dp[i][i][i] = comb[i-1][i-1]\n        for j in range(2, m+1):\n            for l in range(1, min(i, k)+1):\n                dp[i][j][l] = (dp[i][j][l] + dp[i-1][j-1][l-1] + dp[i-1][j][l] * (j-1) + dp[i-1][j-2][l-1] * (j-2)) % p\n        for j in range(1, m+1):\n            sum_dp[i][j] = (sum_dp[i][j-1] + dp[i][j][k]) % p\n    return sum_dp[n][m]\n"}
