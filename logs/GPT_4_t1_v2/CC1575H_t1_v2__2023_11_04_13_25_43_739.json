    "prompt": "The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t. Write a function to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there are exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '100101011', '101']\nOutput: [0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 3]\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '101101011', '111']\nOutput: [1, 1, 0, 1, 6, -1, -1, -1]",
