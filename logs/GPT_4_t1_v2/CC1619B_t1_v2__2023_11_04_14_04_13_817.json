{"prompt": "Polycarp likes squares and cubes of positive integers. Here is the beginning of the sequence of numbers he likes: 1, 4, 8, 9, .... For a given number n, write a function to count the number of integers from 1 to n that Polycarp likes. In other words, find the number of such x that x is a square of a positive integer number or a cube of a positive integer number (or both a square and a cube simultaneously). The function must receive an integer n, and return an integer.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: 10\nOutput: 4\n\nInput: 2\nOutput: 1\n\nInput: 25\nOutput: 5", "response": "def polycarp_likes(n):\n    count = 0\n    lower_limit = 1\n    upper_limit = int(n**(1/2))\n    for i in range(lower_limit, upper_limit + 1):\n        count += 1 \n        if i**3 <= n:\n            count += 1\n    return count"}
