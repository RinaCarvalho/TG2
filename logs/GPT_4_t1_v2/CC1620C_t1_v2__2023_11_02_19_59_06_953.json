{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['4', '3', 'a*']\nOutput: abbb\n\nInput: ['1', '3', 'a**a']\nOutput: abbba\n\nInput: ['3', '20', '**a***']\nOutput: babbbbbbbbbb", "response": "def xth_lexico(k, x, s):\n    y, answers = [k+1] * len(s), []\n    for i in range(len(s)-1, -1, -1):\n        if s[i] == \"*\":\n            for j in range(y[i+1]-1,-1,-1):\n                if j * y[i] < x:\n                    x -= j * y[i]\n                    answers.append('b'*j)\n                    break\n                y[i] = j\n        else:\n            answers.append('a')\n    return \"\".join(reversed(answers))"}
