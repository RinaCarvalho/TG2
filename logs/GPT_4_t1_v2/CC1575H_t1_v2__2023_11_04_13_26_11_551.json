{"prompt": "The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t. Write a function to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there are exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '100101011', '101']\nOutput: [0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 3]\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '101101011', '111']\nOutput: [1, 1, 0, 1, 6, -1, -1, -1]", "response": "def min_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    prefix = [0] * (len(a)+1)\n    dp = [[0 for _ in range(len(a)+1)] for __ in range(len(a)+1)]\n    result = [-1 for _ in range(len(a)+2)]\n    \n    for i in range(1, len(a)+1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + (a[i-1] != b[0])\n        dp[i][1] = min(dp[i-1][1], prefix[i-1] + (a[i-1] != b[0]))\n\n        for j in range(2, min(i+1, len(b)+1)):\n            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + (a[i-1] != b[j-1])\n            \n        if len(b) < i+1:\n            dp[i][len(b)] = min(dp[i][len(b)], dp[i-1][len(b)])\n\n    for i in range(len(b), len(a)+1):\n        c = sum(b[p] == '1' for p in range(len(b)))\n        for j in range(i-len(b), -1, -1):\n            dp[i][c] = min(dp[i][c], dp[j][c-1] if c-1 >= 0 else 0)\n            if a[j] == '0':\n                break\n            c -= 1\n\n    result[0] = dp[len(a)][0]\n    for i in range(1, len(a)-len(b)+2):\n        if dp[len(a)][i] <= 1e9:\n            result[i] = dp[len(a)][i]\n\n    return result[0:n-m+2]"}
