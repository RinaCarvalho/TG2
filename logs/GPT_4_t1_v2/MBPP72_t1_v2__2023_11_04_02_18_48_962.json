{"prompt": "For a given number, write a function to check whether the number can be represented as the difference of two squares. The function must receive an integer as input and return a boolean.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: 2\nOutput: True\n\nInput: 5\nOutput: True", "response": "def diff_of_squares(n):\n    # All numbers of form 4k (k is a non negative integer) can be expressed as difference of two squares.\n    # All odd numbers can be expressed as difference of two squares.\n    # Thus, checking these two conditions will suffice.\n    return n % 2 == 1 or n % 4 == 0"}
