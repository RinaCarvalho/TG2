{"prompt": "Let c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_n be a permutation of integers 1, 2, \u2026, n. Consider all subsegments of this permutation containing an integer x. Given an integer m, we call the integer x good if there are exactly m different values of maximum on these subsegments. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). A sequence a is a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Given four integers n, m, k and p, write a function to count the number of permutations of length n with exactly k good numbers, modulo p. The function must receive four integers n, m, k and p and return an integer.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['4', '3', '2', '10007']\nOutput: 4\n\nInput: ['6', '4', '1', '769626776']\nOutput: 472\n\nInput: ['66', '11', '9', '6747482']\nOutput: 206331312\n\nInput: ['99', '30', '18', '457567']\nOutput: 77365367", "response": "\ndef count_permutations(n, m, k, p):\n    factorial = [1] * (n+1)\n    rev_factorial = [1] * (n+1)\n    d = [[0]*(n+1) for i in range(n+1)]\n    good = [[0]*(n+1) for i in range(n+1)]\n    rev = [1]\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        factorial[i] = (factorial[i-1] * i) % p\n        rev.append((p - p//i*rev[p%i]%p))\n        rev_factorial[i] = (rev_factorial[i-1] * rev[i]) % p\n    d[0][0] = good[0][0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(i+1):\n            d[i][j] = (d[i-1][j-1] * (i-j) % p if j else 0) + ((j+1)*d[i-1][j])%p\n            good[i][j] = (good[i-1][j-1] * (i-j) % p if j else 0) + (j+1)*(good[i-1][j]+d[i-1][j])%p\n    result, sum_d = 0, 0\n    for i in range(k, min(n, m)+1):\n        sum_d = (sum_d + d[i-1][k-1]) % p if k else 0\n        result = (result+good[n][i]*sum_d% p* factorial[n]%p*rev_factorial[n-i]%p)%p\n    return result\n"}
