{"prompt": "The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t. Write a function to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there are exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '100101011', '101']\nOutput: [0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 3]\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '101101011', '111']\nOutput: [1, 1, 0, 1, 6, -1, -1, -1]", "response": "def min_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    \n    prefix_count = [0]*(m+1) \n    suffix_count = [0]*(m+1)\n    b_count = [0]*(m+1) \n    occurrence = [0]*(m+1) \n    overlap = [0]*(m+1) \n    dp = [[float(\"inf\")]*(n+2) for _ in range(n+2)]  \n    ans = [-1]*(n+2)\n    \n    # Find prefix COUNT\n    for i in range(1, m+1):\n        prefix_count[i] = prefix_count[i-1] + (b[i-1] != '1')\n    \n    # Find Suffix COUNT\n    for i in range(m-1, -1, -1):\n        suffix_count[i] = suffix_count[i+1] + (b[i] != '1')\n  \n    # Count of b\n    b_count[0] = b.count('1')\n    \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        # Fill remaining values\n        for j in range(1, m+1):\n            occurrence[i] = occurrence[i-1] + (a[i-1:i+m-1] == b)\n            overlap[i] = min(overlap[i-1], prefix_count[j] + \n                             (a[i-1:i+m-j-1] != b[j:]))\n        \n        dp[i][occurrence[i]] = 0 \n        \n        # Fill table using dp approach\n        for j in range(occurrence[i], -1, -1):\n            dp[i+1][j] = min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j] + b_count[0] - b_count[1])\n            if j:\n                dp[i+1][j] = min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1] + b_count[0] -\n                                 overlap[i]) \n  \n    for k in range(n+2):\n        ans[k] = min(dp[i][k] + suffix_count[k] for i in range(k, n+1))\n        if ans[k] > n: \n            ans[k] = -1\n\n    return ans[1:n-m+2]"}
