{"prompt": "The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t. Write a function to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there are exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '100101011', '101']\nOutput: [0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 3]\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '101101011', '111']\nOutput: [1, 1, 0, 1, 6, -1, -1, -1]", "response": "def min_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    res = [-1]*(n - m + 2)\n    cnt = [0]*(n - m + 2)\n    for _ in range(n - m + 1):\n        for __ in range(m):\n            cnt[_] += (a[_ + __] != b[__])\n    res[0] = sum(1 if c == '1' else 0 for c in a)\n    res[cnt[0]] = min(res[cnt[0]], res[0] - cnt[0])\n    \n    for _ in range(1, n - m + 1):\n        cnt[_] += cnt[_ - 1] - (a[_ - 1] != b[0]) + (a[_ + m - 1] != b[m - 1])\n        res[cnt[_]] = min(res[cnt[_]], res[cnt[_ - 1]] + (a[_ - 1] != b[0]) - (a[_ + m - 1] == b[m - 1]))\n        \n    fill = -1\n    for _ in range(n - m + 1, -1, -1):\n        if res[_] != -1:\n            fill = res[_]\n        else:\n            res[_] = fill\n    return res\n    \nprint(min_changes(9, 3, '100101011', '101'))\nprint(min_changes(9, 3, '101101011', '111'))"}
