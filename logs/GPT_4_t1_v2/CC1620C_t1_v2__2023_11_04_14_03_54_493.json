{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['4', '3', 'a*']\nOutput: abbb\n\nInput: ['1', '3', 'a**a']\nOutput: abbba\n\nInput: ['3', '20', '**a***']\nOutput: babbbbbbbbbb", "response": "\ndef xth_lexicographically_smallest(k, x, s):\n    s = list(s[::-1])\n    s_len = len(s)\n\n    for i in range(s_len):\n        if s[i] == '*':\n            for b_num in range(k + 1):\n                total_b = b_num * (k + 1) ** (s.count('*') - 1)\n                if total_b < x:\n                    x -= total_b\n                else:\n                    s[i] = 'b' * b_num\n                    break\n    return ''.join(s)[::-1]\n"}
