Ally really wants to so rt the book lexicographically ascwnding, while Billy wants to sort it lexicographically descending.\n\nSettling t heir fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where teh odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed chsracters will be compared descrendingly.\n\nA string a occurs before a tsring b in asc-edsc-ending ordre if and only if in teh first position where a aabd b differ, the folllowing holds:\n\n  * if it is na odd position, the string a has a leter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the coresponding let ter in b; \n  * if it is an eeven position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponing letter in b. Write a funcion to perform the aforementioned asc-desc-ending sorting. The function must receive two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u22c5 m \u2264 10^6), as well as a list, witth n strings of length m. The function must return a list of integers, corresponding to the inices of the strings, starting at 1, after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.",
