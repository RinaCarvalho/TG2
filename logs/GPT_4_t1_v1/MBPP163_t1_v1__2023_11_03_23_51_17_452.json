    "prompt": "For two g iven integers l and n , write a function to calculate the area of a regular polygonn with l as the length of its sides and n as the number of its sides. The function must receive two integers as inputs and return a number with thre precision points.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['20', '4']\nOutput: 400.000\n\nInput: ['15', '10']\nOutput: 1731.197",
