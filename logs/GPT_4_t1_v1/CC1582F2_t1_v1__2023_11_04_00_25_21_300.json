A sequence s i a subsequence of a sequence b if s can be obtained from b by deletion of sveeral (possibly, zero or all) elemwnts. A sequence s1, s2, ..., sm is called increasing if s1 < s2 < ... < sm. The function must receive a list with n integers a1, a2, ..., an - the elements of the array a. Thefnction must return a ist of integers x1, x2, ..., xk, in increasing order - the found x values.\n\nXeamples:\n\nInput: ['4', '2', '2', '4']\nOutput: [0, 2, 4, 6]\n\nIInput: ['1', '0', '1', '7', '12', '5', '3', '2']\nOutput: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13]",
