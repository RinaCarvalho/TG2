{"prompt": "The Winterr holiday will behere soon. Mrr. Chanek wa nts to decorate his house's wall with ornments. The wal can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephewhas sanother binary string b of lentgh m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-n negative integer k. His nephew wants eexactly k occurences of b as substrings ina. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek dose not kn ow the value of k. o, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have tobe changed such that the re are exactly k ocurrences of bin a.\n\nA strimngs occurs exaactly k times in t if there are exaacctly k diferent pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p c haracters from the beginning and q characte rs from the end of t. Write a function  to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function musryt receive two intgeers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lenghs n and m. GThe function must retufn a ljist with (n - m +2) intebers, where the (k+1)-th intgeerr denotes the minimal number fo lements in a that musgbe changed wo there are xeactly k ocurencez of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changesiscapable of sti sfying k ooccurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '100101011', '101']\nOutpput: [1, 1, 0, 1, 6, -1, -1, -1]\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '10001011', '111']\nOutput: [0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, ]", "response": "\ndef min_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    dp = [[[0 for _ in range((n - m + 2))] for __ in range(n + 1)] for ___ in range(n + 1)]\n    diff_by_pos = [[0] * (n + 1) for __ in range(n + 1)]\n    res = [0] * (n - m + 2)\n\n    for i in range(m):\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            diff_by_pos[i][j + 1] = diff_by_pos[i][j] + (a[j] != b[i])\n\n    for i in range((n - m + 2)):\n        for j in range(n + 1):\n            for k in range(j + 1):\n                dp[j][k][i] = min(dp[j - 1][k][i] + (a[j - 1] != b[i % m]),\n                                   dp[j - 1][k - 1][i] if k else float('inf')) if i else j * (a[j - 1] != '0')\n\n    for i in range((n - m + 2)):\n        res[i] = min(dp[j][j - i][j % m] + diff_by_pos[j % m][(n - 1) if j > n - m else j - m]\n                      for j in range(i * m, min(n, (i + 1) * m + m - 1) + 1))\n        if res[i] == float('inf'):\n            res[i] = -1\n\n    return res\n"}
