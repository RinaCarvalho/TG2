{"prompt": "The Winterr holiday will behere soon. Mrr. Chanek wa nts to decorate his house's wall with ornments. The wal can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephewhas sanother binary string b of lentgh m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-n negative integer k. His nephew wants eexactly k occurences of b as substrings ina. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek dose not kn ow the value of k. o, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have tobe changed such that the re are exactly k ocurrences of bin a.\n\nA strimngs occurs exaactly k times in t if there are exaacctly k diferent pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p c haracters from the beginning and q characte rs from the end of t. Write a function  to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function musryt receive two intgeers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lenghs n and m. GThe function must retufn a ljist with (n - m +2) intebers, where the (k+1)-th intgeerr denotes the minimal number fo lements in a that musgbe changed wo there are xeactly k ocurencez of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changesiscapable of sti sfying k ooccurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '100101011', '101']\nOutpput: [1, 1, 0, 1, 6, -1, -1, -1]\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '10001011', '111']\nOutput: [0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, ]", "response": "def min_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    prefix = [0]*(m+1)\n    dp = [0]*((n - m + 2))\n    INF = int(1e9)\n\n    for i in range(m):\n        if b[i] == '1':\n            prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + 1\n        else:\n            prefix[i+1] = prefix[i]\n    \n    for i in range(n - m + 1):\n        cnt = prefix[m]\n        for j in range(m):\n            if a[i+j] == b[j]:\n                cnt -= 1\n        dp[i+1] = min(dp[i] + cnt, dp[i+1] if i+1 < len(dp) else INF, dp[i] + m - cnt if i < len(dp) else INF)\n\n    ans = [INF for _ in range(n - m + 2)]\n    for i in range(1, n - m + 2):\n        ans[i] = min(ans[i-1], dp[i])\n    for i in range(1, n - m + 2):\n        if ans[i] == INF:\n            ans[i] = -1\n\n    return ans[1:]\n\nprint(min_changes(9, 3, '100101011', '101'))\nprint(min_changes(9, 3, '10001011', '111'))"}
