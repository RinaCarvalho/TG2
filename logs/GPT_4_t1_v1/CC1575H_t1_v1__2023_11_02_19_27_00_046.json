{"prompt": "The Winter holiday wil be here soon. Mr. Chan ek wants to decroate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of legth mn. His favorite nephew has another binary string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exaactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deletijng p characters from yhe beginning and q characters from the end of t. Write a function to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The fuctoin must return a list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there are exavgly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: [ '9', '3', '100101011', '101']\nOutput: [1, 1, 0, 1, 6, -1, -1, -1]\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '101101011', '111']\nOutput: [0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 3]", "response": "def min_change(n, m, a, b):\n    dp= [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    f = [0] * (n+1)\n    g = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    b = '0' * (n+1-len(b)) + b\n    a = '0' + a\n    b = '0' + b\n    pre = {0: 0}\n    INF = 10**9\n    res = []\n\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        dp[i][i] = dp[i-1][i-1] + (a[i] != b[1])\n        for j in range(i+1, n+1):\n            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1] + (a[i] != b[i-j+1]))\n\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        f[i]= min(f[i-j] + dp[i][i-j+1] for j in range(min(i,m), 0, -1))\n        for j in range(i+1):\n            g[i][j] = min(g[i-1][j] + (a[i] != b[m]), (g[i-j-1][j-1] if j else INF) + dp[i][i-j+1])\n\n    for i in range(1, n+1): \n        pre[i] = min(pre[i-1], f[i])\n\n    for i in range(n-m+2): \n        res.append(min(g[j][i] + pre[j-i-1] if i <= j else INF for j in range(i, n+1)) if i <= n else -1)\n        \n    return res"}
