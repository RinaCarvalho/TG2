{"prompt": "Igven an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Differen t asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is caled a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the sftring p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a stribg s. The function must return a string consistimng only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: [' 4', '3', 'a*']\nOutput: abb\n\nInput: ['1', '3', 'a**a']\nOutput: abba\n\nInput: ['3', '20', '**a***']\nOutput: babbbbbbbbb", "response": "def get_ba_string(k, x, s):\n    k, x = int(k), int(x)\n    pos = [0]*(len(s)+1)\n    coef = [0]*(len(s)+1)\n    f = [0]*(len(s)+1)\n    pos[0] = len(s)\n    coef[0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, len(s)+1):\n        pos[i] = pos[i-1] - (1 if s[pos[i-1]-1] == '*' else 0)\n        coef[i] = coef[i-1]*(k+1 if s[pos[i-1]-1] == '*' else 1)\n    i,j,r,x,f[0] = len(s),0,'',x-1,[0]*(len(s)+1)\n    while i > 0:\n        if x // coef[i-1] == 0:\n            if s[pos[i]-1] == '*':\n                f[pos[i]-1] = j\n                r = 'b'*j + r\n                j = 0\n            else:\n                r = 'a' + r\n            i -= 1\n        else:\n            x = x - coef[i-1]\n            if s[pos[i]-1] == '*':\n                j += 1\n    return r"}
