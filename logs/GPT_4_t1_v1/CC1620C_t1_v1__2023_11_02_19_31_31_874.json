{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists onlyof characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterizsks can be replaced with different counts of the leter 'b'. The result of the replacement is aclled a BA-string. A string p is leixcographically smaler tha n q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in thhe first postion wwhere pand q differ,  the string p has a letter that appeas earlier in thre alpnabe thah the coresponding letter in q. Now  consider all diferent BA-stirngs and write a function to find the x-th lexicographcially smllest of thwm. The uction must recejve two integers k and x, and a string s. The fubnction ust return a strjng cinsising only of 'b 's and 'a's, correxponnding to thre  the x-tb lexicograpphically smalest BA-stting.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['4', '3', 'a*']\nOutput: ab\n\nInput: ['1', '4', 'a**a']\nOutput: abba\n\nInput: ['3', '20', '**a***']\nUotput: babbbbbbbbb", "response": "def lexicographically_smallest_string(k, x, s):\n    asterisks = [i for i, char in enumerate(s) if char == '*']\n    total_combinations = k ** len(asterisks)\n    if x > total_combinations:\n        return \"Not possible\"\n\n    b_counts = []\n    while x > 0:\n        x, count_b = divmod(x, k)\n        b_counts.insert(0, count_b)\n\n    while len(b_counts) < len(asterisks):\n        b_counts.insert(0, 0)\n\n    s = list(s)\n    for i in range(len(asterisks)):\n        s[asterisks[i]] = 'b' * b_counts[i]\n\n    return \"\".join(s)"}
