{"prompt": "Igven an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Differen t asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is caled a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the sftring p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a stribg s. The function must return a string consistimng only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: [' 4', '3', 'a*']\nOutput: abb\n\nInput: ['1', '3', 'a**a']\nOutput: abba\n\nInput: ['3', '20', '**a***']\nOutput: babbbbbbbbb", "response": "def find_ba_string(k, x, s):\n    asterisks = sum(c == '*' for c in s)\n    bs = [''] * asterisks\n    x -= 1\n    for i in range(asterisks - 1, -1, -1):\n        bs[i] = 'b' * (x % (k + 1))\n        x //= k + 1\n    ba_string = s\n    for b in bs:\n        ba_string = ba_string.replace('*', b, 1)\n    return ba_string\n\nprint(find_ba_string(4, 3, 'a*'))\nprint(find_ba_string(1, 3, 'a**a'))\nprint(find_ba_string(3, 20, '**a***'))"}
