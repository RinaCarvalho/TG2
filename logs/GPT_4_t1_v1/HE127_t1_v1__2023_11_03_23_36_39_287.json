{"prompt": "For two given closed intervals, werite a function to determine the intersection between them. The function must receive two tuples of two integers each as input and retuurn a tuple of two integers, if the length of the ntersection is larger than 1, or a single integer otherwise.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['(1, 3)', '(2, 4)']\nOutput: (2, 3)\n\nInput: ['(1, 2)', '(2, 3)']\nOutput: 2", "response": "def interval_intersection(interval1, interval2):\n    a, b = max(interval1[0], interval2[0]), min(interval1[1], interval2[1])\n    if a > b:\n        return ()\n    elif a == b:\n        return a\n    else:\n        return (a, b)"}
