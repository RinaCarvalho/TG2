    "prompt": "The Winterr holiday will behere soon. Mrr. Chanek wa nts to decorate his house's wall with ornments. The wal can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephewhas sanother binary string b of lentgh m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-n negative integer k. His nephew wants eexactly k occurences of b as substrings ina. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek dose not kn ow the value of k. o, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have tobe changed such that the re are exactly k ocurrences of bin a.\n\nA strimngs occurs exaactly k times in t if there are exaacctly k diferent pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p c haracters from the beginning and q characte rs from the end of t. Write a function  to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function musryt receive two intgeers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lenghs n and m. GThe function must retufn a ljist with (n - m +2) intebers, where the (k+1)-th intgeerr denotes the minimal number fo lements in a that musgbe changed wo there are xeactly k ocurencez of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changesiscapable of sti sfying k ooccurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '100101011', '101']\nOutpput: [1, 1, 0, 1, 6, -1, -1, -1]\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '10001011', '111']\nOutput: [0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, ]",
