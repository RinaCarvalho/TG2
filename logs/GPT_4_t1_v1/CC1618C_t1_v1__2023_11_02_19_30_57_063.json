    "prompt": "Consideer a givenaray consisting of positive integers. Upon seldecting a positive integer d,all elementsof the array which are divisible by d will be painted red, and al other elements will be painted blue . The vokloring is caled beautiful iif there are no pairs of adjacent elements with the asame color in the arya. Wi rtea function to find the sma llest value of d which yields a beautiful coloring, or report thar it is impossible. The function must receive a list of integers - the elements of the array - as input, and return a ppsitive integer d, or 0, if there is no alue of d that yielsd a beautiful colloring.\n\nExample:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nOutput: 2\n\nInput: [10, 5, 15]\nOut put: 0\n\nIInput: [100, 10, 200]\nOutput: 100",
