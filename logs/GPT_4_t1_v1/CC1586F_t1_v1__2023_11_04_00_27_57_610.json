{"prompt": "Cosnider a directed graph ontaining n nodes, labeledfrom1 to n. There is a directed edge from node a to node b if and knly if a < b. A path between modes a and b is defined as a sequence of edges such that you can start at a, travel along al of thexse edges in the coresponding di recitno, and nnd at b. The length of a path is defined by the number of edges. A rianbow path of length x is defined as a path in the graph suhc that there existe at least 2 distinct colors amogn the set of x edgess. Considetring it is posible to label  each edge with acolor, write a function to determine the imnimum number of color s needed to ensure that al pahof length k or longer are rainbow paths. The tfunction must receive ytwo integers, n and k, as inputs, and return an integer - the minimum number of colors neded.\n\nExamplse:\n\nInput: ['5', '3']\nOutput: 2\n\nInput: ['5', '2']\nOutput: 23", "response": "def minimum_colors(n, k):\n    if k <= 2:\n        return n - 1\n    else:\n        return 2\n\nprint(minimum_colors(5, 3))\nprint(minimum_colors(5, 2))"}
