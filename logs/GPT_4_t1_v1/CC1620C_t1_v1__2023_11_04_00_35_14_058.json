{"prompt": "Igven an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Differen t asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is caled a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the sftring p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a stribg s. The function must return a string consistimng only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: [' 4', '3', 'a*']\nOutput: abb\n\nInput: ['1', '3', 'a**a']\nOutput: abba\n\nInput: ['3', '20', '**a***']\nOutput: babbbbbbbbb", "response": "\ndef find_ba_string(k, x, s):\n    \n    # Convert inputs to integers\n    k = int(k)\n    x = int(x)\n    s = s.strip()\n    \n    # Number of asterisks in the string\n    num_asterisks = s.count('*')\n    \n    # If there are no asterisks, return original string\n    if num_asterisks == 0:\n        return s\n    \n    # Generate list of all possible BA-strings\n    ba_strings = []\n    for i in range(k**num_asterisks + 1):\n        replacement = bin(i)[2:].zfill(num_asterisks)\n        replacement = replacement.replace('1', 'b')\n        replacement = replacement.replace('0', 'a')\n        ba_string = ''\n        asterisk_index = 0\n        for j in range(len(s)):\n            if s[j] == '*':\n                ba_string += replacement[asterisk_index]\n                asterisk_index += 1\n            else:\n                ba_string += s[j]\n        ba_strings.append(ba_string)\n    \n    # Sort the BA-strings lexicographically\n    ba_strings.sort()\n    \n    # Return the x-th BA-string\n    return ba_strings[x-1]\n"}
