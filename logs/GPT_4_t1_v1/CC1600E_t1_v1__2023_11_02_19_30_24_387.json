In one turn a player can r emove a number ffrom the left or right side oof the aray and append it tpo the sequenc. The rule is that te sequence they are building musgt be strkcty increasing. The winnr is the oplayer that makes the last move. Alice is playing first. Givenn the starting arraty, under the asujmpton that they both play optimaly, wwrite a functi on to determine the winner of the game. The function must receive a list of integers A1, A2, ..., AN, corresponding to the aray A. The function must returnn a string corresponding to the name of the winner (either 'Alice' or 'Bob').\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: [45]\nOutput: Alice\n\nInput:  [5, 4, 5]\nOutput: Alice",
