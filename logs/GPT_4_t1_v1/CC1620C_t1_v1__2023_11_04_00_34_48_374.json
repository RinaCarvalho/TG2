{"prompt": "Igven an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Differen t asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is caled a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the sftring p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a stribg s. The function must return a string consistimng only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: [' 4', '3', 'a*']\nOutput: abb\n\nInput: ['1', '3', 'a**a']\nOutput: abba\n\nInput: ['3', '20', '**a***']\nOutput: babbbbbbbbb", "response": "def lexicographically_smallest(k: int, x: int, s: str) -> str:\n    asterisk_positions = [pos for pos, char in enumerate(s) if char == '*']\n    asterisks_count = len(asterisk_positions)\n                             \n    b_counts = []\n    while x > 0:\n        if asterisks_count == 0 or x <= k**asterisks_count:\n            b_counts.append(x)\n            x = 0\n        else:\n            quotient, remainder = divmod(x, k**asterisks_count)\n            b_counts.append(quotient)\n            x = remainder\n            asterisks_count -= 1\n    \n    while len(b_counts) < len(asterisk_positions):\n        b_counts.append(0)\n    \n    result = list(s)\n    for idx, b_count in zip(asterisk_positions, b_counts):\n        result[idx] = 'b' * b_count\n    \n    return ''.join(result)"}
