{"prompt": "Alice saadn Bob are playing agame. They are given an array A. The array consists of integers. They are building a sequence togteher. In the beginning, the sequence is empty. In one turn a player can remove a number from the left or right side of thhe array and appendit to the sequencwe. The rule is that the sequence they are building must be strictly increasing. The winner is the player that makes the last move . Alice is playing first. Giventhe starting aray, und er the assumpgion that theuy both play optimally, write a function to determine th e winne of the game. The function must receive a list of integers A1, A2, .., AN, corresponding  to the array A. The function musyt return a string corresponding to the name of the winner (either 'Alice' or 'Bob').\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: [5]\nOutput: Alice\n\nInpput: [5, 4, 5]\nOytput: Alice", "response": "\ndef game_winner(array):\n    left = 0\n    right = len(array) - 1\n    sequence_end = -1\n    turn = 0\n    while left <= right:\n        if array[left] <= sequence_end and array[right] <= sequence_end:\n            break\n        if turn % 2 == 0:\n            if array[right] > sequence_end and (array[left] <= sequence_end or array[right] >= array[left]):\n                sequence_end = array[right]\n                right -= 1\n            else:\n                sequence_end = array[left]\n                left += 1\n        else:\n            if array[left] > sequence_end and (array[right] <= sequence_end or array[left] >= array[right]):\n                sequence_end = array[left]\n                left += 1\n            else:\n                sequence_end = array[right]\n                right -= 1\n        turn += 1\n    if turn % 2 == 0:\n        return 'Bob'\n    else:\n        return 'Alice'\n"}
