{"prompt": "The Winterr holiday will behere soon. Mrr. Chanek wa nts to decorate his house's wall with ornments. The wal can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephewhas sanother binary string b of lentgh m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-n negative integer k. His nephew wants eexactly k occurences of b as substrings ina. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek dose not kn ow the value of k. o, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have tobe changed such that the re are exactly k ocurrences of bin a.\n\nA strimngs occurs exaactly k times in t if there are exaacctly k diferent pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p c haracters from the beginning and q characte rs from the end of t. Write a function  to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function musryt receive two intgeers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lenghs n and m. GThe function must retufn a ljist with (n - m +2) intebers, where the (k+1)-th intgeerr denotes the minimal number fo lements in a that musgbe changed wo there are xeactly k ocurencez of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changesiscapable of sti sfying k ooccurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '100101011', '101']\nOutpput: [1, 1, 0, 1, 6, -1, -1, -1]\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '10001011', '111']\nOutput: [0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, ]", "response": "\ndef min_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n    \n    # Calculate prefix sum array for a where prefix[i] \n    # denotes the number of unmatched characters from 0 to i.\n    for i in range(m):\n        prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + (a[i] != b[i])\n\n    res = [0]*(n-m+2)\n    dp = [float('inf')]*(n-m+2)\n    \n    dp[0] = 0\n\n    # Construct dp array where dp[i] denotes\n    # minimum number of changes to have exactly i occurrences of b in a.\n    for i in range(1,n+1):\n        dp_new = dp[::]\n        \n        for k in range(min(i//m, n-m+1),-1,-1):\n            dp_new[k+1] = min(dp_new[k+1], dp[k] + prefix[i] - prefix[i-m] if i >= m else float('inf')) \n        dp = dp_new[::]\n\n    # If it is impossible to get k occurrences, set value as -1.\n    for i in range(1,n - m + 2):\n        if dp[i] == float('inf'):\n            dp[i] = -1\n\n    return dp[1:]\n\n# Invoking the function with sample inputs\nprint(min_changes(9, 3, '100101011', '101'))\nprint(min_changes(9, 3, '10001011', '111'))\n"}
