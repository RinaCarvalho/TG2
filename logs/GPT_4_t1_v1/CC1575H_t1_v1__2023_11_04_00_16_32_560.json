{"prompt": "The Winterr holiday will behere soon. Mrr. Chanek wa nts to decorate his house's wall with ornments. The wal can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephewhas sanother binary string b of lentgh m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-n negative integer k. His nephew wants eexactly k occurences of b as substrings ina. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek dose not kn ow the value of k. o, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have tobe changed such that the re are exactly k ocurrences of bin a.\n\nA strimngs occurs exaactly k times in t if there are exaacctly k diferent pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p c haracters from the beginning and q characte rs from the end of t. Write a function  to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function musryt receive two intgeers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lenghs n and m. GThe function must retufn a ljist with (n - m +2) intebers, where the (k+1)-th intgeerr denotes the minimal number fo lements in a that musgbe changed wo there are xeactly k ocurencez of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changesiscapable of sti sfying k ooccurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '100101011', '101']\nOutpput: [1, 1, 0, 1, 6, -1, -1, -1]\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '10001011', '111']\nOutput: [0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, ]", "response": "\ndef min_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    # Count appearances of b in a\n    appearances = [0] * (n + 1)\n    b_len = len(b)\n\n    for i in range(n - m + 1):\n        sub_string = a[i:i+b_len]\n        appearances[i + 1] = appearances[i]\n        \n        if sub_string == b:\n            appearances[i + 1] += 1\n\n    # Create a dynamic programming table\n    # dp[i][j] stores the minimum number of changes needed\n    # for b to appear i times exactly up to the jth character in a\n    dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n - m + 2)]\n    dp[0][0] = 0\n\n    # Dynamic programming\n    for i in range(n):\n        dp[0][i + 1] = min(dp[0][i + 1], dp[0][i] + a[i] != '0')\n        for j in range(1, min(i + 2, n - m + 2)):\n            dp[j][i + 1] = min(dp[j][i + 1], dp[j][i] + (a[i] != '1'))\n            if i >= m - 1:\n                dp[appearances[i - m + 2]][i + 1] = min(dp[appearances[i - m + 2]][i + 1], dp[appearances[i - m + 2] - 1][i - m + 1] + sum(a[k] != b[k] for k in range(i - m + 1, i + 1)))\n\n    # Get the minimal number of changes for each k\n    result = []\n    min_val = float('inf')\n\n    for k in range(n - m + 2):\n        min_val = min(min_val, dp[k][-1])\n        result.append(min_val if min_val != float('inf') else -1)\n\n    return result\n"}
