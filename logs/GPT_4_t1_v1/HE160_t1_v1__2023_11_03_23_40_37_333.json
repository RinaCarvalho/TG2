{"prompt": "Given a list of integers and a list of operations, write a function that builds an algebraic expresion by sequentiallty placing each operation in the list of operations between two inteegers in the list of integers, and calculates the result of this expresion. The functiknmust receive a list of integers and a list of strings and return ah integer.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['[2, 3, 4, 5]', \"['+', '*', '-']\"]\nOutput: 9\n\nInput: ['[2, 3, 4, 5]', \"['**', '*', '+']\"]\nOutput: 37", "response": "def calculate_expression(numbers, operations):\n    numbers = eval(numbers[0])\n    operations = eval(operations[0])\n    result = numbers[0]\n    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):\n        if operations[i-1] == '+':\n            result += numbers[i]\n        elif operations[i-1] == '-':\n            result -=  numbers[i]\n        elif operations[i-1] == '*':\n            result *=  numbers[i]\n        elif operations[i-1] == '/':\n            result /=  numbers[i]\n        elif operations[i-1] == '**':\n            result **= numbers[i]\n    return result"}
