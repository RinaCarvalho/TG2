{"prompt": "The Winterr holiday will behere soon. Mrr. Chanek wa nts to decorate his house's wall with ornments. The wal can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephewhas sanother binary string b of lentgh m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-n negative integer k. His nephew wants eexactly k occurences of b as substrings ina. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek dose not kn ow the value of k. o, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have tobe changed such that the re are exactly k ocurrences of bin a.\n\nA strimngs occurs exaactly k times in t if there are exaacctly k diferent pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p c haracters from the beginning and q characte rs from the end of t. Write a function  to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function musryt receive two intgeers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lenghs n and m. GThe function must retufn a ljist with (n - m +2) intebers, where the (k+1)-th intgeerr denotes the minimal number fo lements in a that musgbe changed wo there are xeactly k ocurencez of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changesiscapable of sti sfying k ooccurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '100101011', '101']\nOutpput: [1, 1, 0, 1, 6, -1, -1, -1]\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '10001011', '111']\nOutput: [0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, ]", "response": "\ndef min_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    a = list(a)\n    b = list(b)\n    prefix = [0] * (n+2)\n    dp = [[0] * (n+2) for _ in range(n+2)]\n    inf = int(1e9)\n    \n    if a[:m] == b:\n        dp[0][0] = 0\n    else:\n        dp[0][0] = sum([a[i] != b[i] for i in range(m)])\n    \n    prefix[0] = dp[0][0]\n    \n    for i in range(m, n+1):\n        minVal = min(dp[j][i-1] + (a[i] != b[(i-j)%m]) for j in range(min(i,m-1), -1, -1))\n        \n        if a[i] == b[0]:\n            minVal = min(minVal, (dp[1][i-1] if i > m-1 else 0)+(a[i] != b[0]))\n        \n        dp[0][i] = minVal\n        prefix[i] = min(prefix[i-1], dp[0][i])\n    \n    for j in range(1, m+1):\n        for i in range(j, n+1):\n            minVal = dp[(j-1)%m][i-1] + (a[i] != b[(i-j)%m])\n            \n            if i > j-1 and a[i] == b[0]:\n                minVal = min(minVal, (dp[1][i-1] if i > m-1 else 0)+(a[i] != b[0]))\n            \n            dp[j%m][i] = minVal\n            prefix[i] = min(prefix[i], dp[j%m][i])\n    \n    res = [prefix[i] if prefix[i] <= i else -1 for i in range(n-m+2)]\n    return res\n"}
