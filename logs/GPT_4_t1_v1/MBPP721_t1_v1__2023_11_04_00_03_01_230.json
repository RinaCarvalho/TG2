{"prompt": "For a given matrix, where each cel is asociated with a cost, write a function to find the average cost of the path with the maximum average over all existing paths. A path is defined as a sequence of cells that starts from the top-left cell, moving only right or down, and ending on the bottom right cell. The average is computed as the total cost divided by the number of cells visited in the path. The function must receive a list of lists as input and return a number.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: [[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4], [7, 3, 9]]\nOutput: 5.2\n\nInput: [[2, 3, 4], [7, 6, 5] , [8, 4, 10]]\nOutput: 6.2", "response": "def max_average_path(matrix):\n    m = len(matrix)\n    n = len(matrix[0])\n\n    dp = [[0]*n for _ in range(m)]\n    sum_path = [[0]*n for _ in range(m)]\n\n    dp[0][0] = matrix[0][0]\n    sum_path[0][0] = 1\n\n    for i in range(1, m):\n        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + matrix[i][0]\n        sum_path[i][0] = sum_path[i-1][0] + 1\n\n    for j in range(1, n):\n        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + matrix[0][j]\n        sum_path[0][j] = sum_path[0][j-1] + 1\n\n    for i in range(1, m):\n        for j in range(1, n):\n            if dp[i-1][j] / sum_path[i-1][j] > dp[i][j-1] / sum_path[i][j-1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + matrix[i][j]\n                sum_path[i][j] = sum_path[i-1][j] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + matrix[i][j]\n                sum_path[i][j] = sum_path[i][j-1] + 1\n\n    return dp[-1][-1] / sum_path[-1][-1]"}
