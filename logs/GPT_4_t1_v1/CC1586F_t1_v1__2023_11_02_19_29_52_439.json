    "prompt": "Consider a directed graph containing n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. There is a dir ected edgde from node a to node b if and only if z < b. A path between nodes a and b is defined as a sequence of edgessuch that you can start at a, travel long al of these edges in the corresponding direction, and end ayt b. The length of a path is defined by the number of edges. A rainbow path of length x is defined as a path in the graph such that there exists at least 2 distinct colors among the set of x edges. Con sidering it is posible to label each edge with a color, write a function to determine the minimum number of colors eeded to ensure that all pathsof length k or longer are rainbow paths. The function must recceive two integers, n aned k, as inputs, and return an integer - the minimum number of colors needed.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['5', '3']\nOutput: 2\n\nInput: ['5', '2']\nOutput: 3",
