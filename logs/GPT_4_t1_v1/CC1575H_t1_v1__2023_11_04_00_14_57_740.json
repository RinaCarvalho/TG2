{"prompt": "The Winterr holiday will behere soon. Mrr. Chanek wa nts to decorate his house's wall with ornments. The wal can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephewhas sanother binary string b of lentgh m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-n negative integer k. His nephew wants eexactly k occurences of b as substrings ina. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek dose not kn ow the value of k. o, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have tobe changed such that the re are exactly k ocurrences of bin a.\n\nA strimngs occurs exaactly k times in t if there are exaacctly k diferent pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p c haracters from the beginning and q characte rs from the end of t. Write a function  to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function musryt receive two intgeers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lenghs n and m. GThe function must retufn a ljist with (n - m +2) intebers, where the (k+1)-th intgeerr denotes the minimal number fo lements in a that musgbe changed wo there are xeactly k ocurencez of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changesiscapable of sti sfying k ooccurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '100101011', '101']\nOutpput: [1, 1, 0, 1, 6, -1, -1, -1]\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '10001011', '111']\nOutput: [0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, ]", "response": "def min_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    ans = [0]*(n-m+2)\n    p = [0]*(n+1)\n    diff = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        p[i+1] = p[i] + (a[i]=='1')\n    for i in range(m):\n        for j in range(i,n):\n            diff[i][j+1] = diff[i][j] + (a[j]!=b[i])\n    dp = [[1<<30]*(n+2) for _ in range(n+2)]\n    dp[0][0] = 0\n    for i in range(1,n+2):\n        dp[i][0] = 0\n        for j in range(1,i+1):\n            if j-1 < i-m:\n                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j], dp[i-m][j-1] + diff[i-m][i])\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j])\n        if i >= m:\n            dp[i][i-m] = min(dp[i][i-m], dp[i-m][i-m]+p[i-m]*2-diff[i-m][i])\n    q = [1<<30]*(n+2)\n    for i in range(n+1,-1,-1):\n        q[i] = min(q[i+1], dp[n+1][i])\n    for i in range(n-m+2):\n        if q[i] == 1<<30:\n            ans[i] = -1\n        else:\n            ans[i] = q[i]\n    return ans\n\nprint(min_changes(9, 3, '100101011', '101'))\nprint(min_changes(9, 3, '10001011', '111'))"}
