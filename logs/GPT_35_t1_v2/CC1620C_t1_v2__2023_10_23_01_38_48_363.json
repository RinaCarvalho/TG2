{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['4', '3', 'a*']\nOutput: abbb\n\nInput: ['1', '3', 'a**a']\nOutput: abbba\n\nInput: ['3', '20', '**a***']\nOutput: babbbbbbbbbb", "response": "import itertools\n\ndef generate_ba_strings(k, s):\n    count = s.count('*')\n    replacement = [range(k+1)] * count\n    combinations = itertools.product(*replacement)\n\n    ba_strings = []\n    for combination in combinations:\n        i = 0\n        ba_string = ''\n        for c in s:\n            if c == '*':\n                ba_string += 'b' * combination[i]\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                ba_string += c\n        ba_strings.append(ba_string)\n      \n    return sorted(ba_strings)\n\ndef get_xth_lexicographically_smallest(k, s, x):\n    ba_strings = generate_ba_strings(k, s)\n    return ba_strings[x-1]"}
