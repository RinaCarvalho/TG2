{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['4', '3', 'a*']\nOutput: abbb\n\nInput: ['1', '3', 'a**a']\nOutput: abbba\n\nInput: ['3', '20', '**a***']\nOutput: babbbbbbbbbb", "response": "from itertools import product\n\ndef generate_BA_strings(k, s):\n    s = list(s)\n    asterisk_indices = [index for index, char in enumerate(s) if char == '*']\n    num_asterisks = len(asterisk_indices)\n    possible_counts = [range(k + 1)] * num_asterisks\n    for counts in product(*possible_counts):\n        for index, count in zip(asterisk_indices, counts):\n            s[index] = 'b' * count\n        yield ''.join(s)\n\ndef get_lexicographically_smallest_BA_string(k, x, s):\n    strings = sorted(generate_BA_strings(k, s))\n    return strings[x - 1]\n\nk = int(input())\nx = int(input())\ns = input()\nget_lexicographically_smallest_BA_string(k, x, s)"}
