{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['4', '3', 'a*']\nOutput: abbb\n\nInput: ['1', '3', 'a**a']\nOutput: abbba\n\nInput: ['3', '20', '**a***']\nOutput: babbbbbbbbbb", "response": "\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef get_lexicographically_smallest(k, x, s):\n    bs_count = s.count('*')\n    all_bs = list(product(range(k + 1), repeat=bs_count))\n\n    for b_values in sorted(all_bs):\n        s_copy = s\n        for b in b_values:\n            s_copy = s_copy.replace('*', 'b'*b, 1)\n        if x == 1:\n            return s_copy.replace('*', 'a')\n        x -= 1\n\n# Testing the function with the given examples\nprint(get_lexicographically_smallest(4, 3, 'a*'))\nprint(get_lexicographically_smallest(1, 3, 'a**a'))\nprint(get_lexicographically_smallest(3, 20, '**a***'))\n"}
