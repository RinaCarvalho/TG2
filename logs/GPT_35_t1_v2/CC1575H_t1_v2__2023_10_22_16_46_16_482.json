{"prompt": "The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t. Write a function to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there are exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '100101011', '101']\nOutput: [0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 3]\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '101101011', '111']\nOutput: [1, 1, 0, 1, 6, -1, -1, -1]", "response": "def min_elements_changed(n, m, a, b):\n    # Initialize a list to store the counts of minimum elements changed\n    # The list will have length (n - m + 2) since k ranges from 0 to n - m + 1\n    counts = [0] * (n - m + 2)\n    \n    # Iterate through all possible values of k\n    for k in range(n - m + 2):\n        # Initialize a counter for the current value of k\n        current_count = 0\n        \n        # Iterate through all possible starting positions of b in a\n        for start in range(n - m + 1):\n            # Check if b can occur exactly k times at the current starting position\n            occurrences, deletion_count = 0, 0\n            while deletion_count <= start:\n                if b == a[start - deletion_count:start - deletion_count + m]:\n                    occurrences += 1\n                deletion_count += 1\n            \n            # If the number of occurrences of b is equal to k, update the counter\n            if occurrences == k:\n                current_count += 1\n        \n        # If there is no way to satisfy k occurrences, set the current count to -1\n        if current_count == 0:\n            current_count = -1\n        \n        # Store the current count in the list of counts\n        counts[k] = current_count\n    \n    # Return the list of counts\n    return counts"}
