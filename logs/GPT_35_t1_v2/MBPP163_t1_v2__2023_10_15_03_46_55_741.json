{"prompt": "For two given integers l and n, write a function to calculate the area of a regular polygon with l as the length of its sides and n as the number of its sides. The function must receive two integers as inputs and return a number with three precision points.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['4', '20']\nOutput: 400.000\n\nInput: ['10', '15']\nOutput: 1731.197", "response": "from math import tan, pi\n\ndef calculate_area(l, n):\n    apothem = l / (2 * tan(pi / n))\n    area = 0.5 * apothem * l * n\n    return round(area, 3)"}
