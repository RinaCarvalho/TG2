    "prompt": "Consider a directed graph containing n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. There is a directed edge from node a to node b if and only if a < b. A path between nodes a and b is defined as a sequence of edges such that you can start at a, travel along all of these edges in the corresponding direction, and end at b. The length of a path is defined by the number of edges. A rainbow path of length x is defined as a path in the graph such that there exists at least 2 distinct colors among the set of x edges. Considering it is possible to label each edge with a color, write a function to determine the minimum number of colors needed to ensure that all paths of length k or longer are rainbow paths. The function must receive two integers, n and k, as inputs, and return an integer - the minimum number of colors needed.\n\nExample:\nInput: ['5', '3']\nLet's think step by step. First, given the number of nodes and the path length, we must list all edges, given that an edge from node a to node b exists only if a < b. Then, we must find all valid paths with length k or longer. We must then compare these paths with each other, looking for edges in common, and determine which edges appear more frequently in all paths, in order to paint some of them, in a way that guarantees each path is a rainbow path. In the example, we have the following valid paths of length 3 or longer: (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 5), (2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 5), (2, 4, 5), (3, 4, 5), (1, 2, 3, 4), (1, 2, 3, 5), (1, 2, 4, 5), (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Given these paths, and the edges belonging to them, we can make every path a rainbow path by coloring the edges (1,2), (3,4), (3,5) and (4,5). Thus, we only need 2 different colors in this example.\nOutput: 2",
