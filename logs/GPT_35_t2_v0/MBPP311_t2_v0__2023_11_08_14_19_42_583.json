{"prompt": "For a given integer, write a function to set its leftmost unset bit. The function must receive an integer as input and return an integer.\n\nExample:\nInput: 10\nLet's think step by step. First, we must convert the input to a binary number. Then, we must locate the leftmost unset bit (0) in the binary string, and set it (change it to 1). Lastly, we must convert the binary number back to decimal. In the example, 10 (in decimal) is converted to b'1010' (in binary). Then, by setting the leftmost unset bit, we have b'1110'. Lastly, converting it back to decimal base, we have 14.\nOutput: 14", "response": "def set_leftmost_unset_bit(num):\n    binary_str = bin(num)[2:]\n    unset_index = binary_str.find('0')\n    updated_binary_str = binary_str[:unset_index] + '1' + binary_str[unset_index+1:]\n    return int(updated_binary_str, 2)\n\nset_leftmost_unset_bit(10)"}
