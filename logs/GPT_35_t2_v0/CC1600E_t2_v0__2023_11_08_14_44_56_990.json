{"prompt": "Alice and Bob are playing a game. They are given an array A. The array consists of integers. They are building a sequence together. In the beginning, the sequence is empty. In one turn a player can remove a number from the left or right side of the array and append it to the sequence. The rule is that the sequence they are building must be strictly increasing. The winner is the player that makes the last move. Alice is playing first. Given the starting array, under the assumption that they both play optimally, write a function to determine the winner of the game. The function must receive a list of integers A1, A2, ..., AN, corresponding to the array A. The function must return a string corresponding to the name of the winner (either 'Alice' or 'Bob').\n\nExample:\nInput: [5]\nLet's think step by step. First, we must define the optimal strategy for the game, which, for both players, consists of removing the largest number from the array and appending it to the sequence, as long as it is larger than the last appended value (otherwise the game is already over). Then, we must take turns playing as Alice and as Bob, until the numbers on the left and right side of the array are both smaller than the last value added to sequence, or when the array is empty, at which point no more moves can be made. Then, we determine the winner, which is the last player to have appended a number to the sequence. In the example, there is only one number to remove from the array and append to the sequence. Therefore, given that the first player is Alice, and after her move the array is then empty, the winner is Alice.\nOutput: Alice", "response": "def winner_game(A):\n    sequence = []\n    alice_turn = True\n    while len(A) > 0:\n        max_num = max(A[0], A[-1])\n        if len(sequence) == 0 or max_num > sequence[-1]:\n            if alice_turn:\n                sequence.append(max_num)\n            else:\n                sequence.insert(0, max_num)\n            A.remove(max_num)\n            alice_turn = not alice_turn\n        else:\n            break\n    if alice_turn:\n        return 'Alice'\n    else:\n        return 'Bob'"}
