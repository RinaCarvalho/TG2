    "prompt": "For a given number, write a function to check whether the number can be represented as the difference of two squares. The function must receive an integer as input and return a boolean.\n\nExample:\nInput: 5\nLet's think step by step. An integer can be expressed as the difference between two squares only if it is not of the form 4k + 2. So, the number's remainder modulo 4 must be tested. In the example, 5 modulo 4 = 1, which means it can be represented as the difference between two squares.\nOutput: True",
