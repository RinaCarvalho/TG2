    "prompt": "For two given closed intervals, write a function to determine the intersection between them. The function must receive two tuples of two integers each as input and return a tuple of two integers, if the length of the intersection is larger than 1, or a single integer otherwise.\n\nExample:\nInput: ['(1, 3)', '(2, 4)']\nLet's think step by step. First, we must compare the start of each interval and find the maximum of the two. Let us call it a1. Then, we must compare the end of each interval and find the minimum of the two. Let us call it a2. Lastly, these values must be compared. If a1 < a2, the intersection is (a1, a2). If a1 = a2, the intersection is a1. If a1 > a2, the intersection does not exist. In the example, a1 = 2, a2 = 3. Given that a1 < a2, the intersection is (2, 3)\nOutput: (2, 3)",
