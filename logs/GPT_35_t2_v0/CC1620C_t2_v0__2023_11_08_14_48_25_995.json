{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExample:\nInput: ['4', '3', 'a*']\nLet's think step by step. First, we must create a list of all possible strings we can obtain by replacing asterisks by 'b's from 0 to k times. Then, we must list these strings in lexicographically ascending order. Then, given x, we can find the x-th smallest BA-string. In the example, the strings we can obtain by replacing '*' with 'b' up to 4 times are: 'a', 'ab', 'abb', 'abbb' and 'abbbb', in lexicographically ascending order. Thus, the third smallest BA-string is 'abb'.\nOutput: abb", "response": "def generate_ba_strings(k, s):\n    ba_strings = [s]\n    for i in range(k):\n        new_strings = []\n        for string in ba_strings:\n            if '*' in string:\n                idx = string.index('*')\n                new_string = string[:idx] + 'b' + string[idx+1:]\n                for j in range(i+1, k+1):\n                    new_strings.append(new_string[:idx] + 'b'*j + new_string[idx+1:])\n            else:\n                new_strings.append(string)\n        ba_strings.extend(new_strings)\n    ba_strings.sort()\n    return ba_strings\n\ndef find_xth_smallest_ba_string(k, x, s):\n    ba_strings = generate_ba_strings(k, s)\n    return ba_strings[x-1]"}
