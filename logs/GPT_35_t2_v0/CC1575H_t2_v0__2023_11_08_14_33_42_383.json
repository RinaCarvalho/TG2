    "prompt": "The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t. Write a function to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there are exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.\n\nExample:\nInput: ['9', '3', '100101011', '101']\nLet's think step by step. Given m and n, we can determine k will range from 0 to n - m + 1. For each k, we must change 0s and 1s in the string a in order to have the substring b appear k times, and we wish to find the minimum number of changes in order to accomplish so. In the example, for k = 0, we wish for the substring '101' never to appear. This can be accomplished in one change by replacing the 6th character in our string a, so that it becomes '10010011'. For k = 1, only one change is needed in order for '101' to appear only once, and that can be to change a to '100001011'. For k = 2, no changes are needed, since '101' already appears twice. This process is repeated until k = n - m + 1, which yields the list of changes for each k: [1, 1, 0, 1, 6, -1, -1, -1].\nOutput: [1, 1, 0, 1, 6, -1, -1, -1]",
