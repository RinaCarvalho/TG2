    "prompt": "For a given array a of length n, write a function to find all integers x >= 0 such that there exists an increasing subsequence of the array a, in which the bitwise XOR of numbers is equal to x. A sequence s is a subsequence of a sequence b if s can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. A sequence s1, s2, ..., sm is called increasing if s1 < s2 < ... < sm. The function must receive a list with n integers a1, a2, ..., an - the elements of the array a. The function must return a list of integers x1, x2, ..., xk, in increasing order - the found x values.\n\nExample:\nInput: ['4', '2', '2', '4']\nLet's think step by step. First, we must determine the largest possible bitwise XOR that can be obtained from an increasing subsequence of the array a. Then for each integer x ranging from 0 to this result, we must test whether there is an increasing subsequence of the array a whose bitwise XOR of its elements is equal to x, and, if so, add it to a list to be returned. In the example, for x = 0, it is possible to choose the empty subsequence []. For x = 2, it is possible to choose the subsequence [2]. For x = 4, we can choose the subsequence [4]. Lastly, for x = 6, we can choose subsequence [2, 4], given that 2 ^ 4 = b'10' ^ b'100' = b'110' = 6. Therefore, we end up with the list [0, 2, 4, 6].\nOutput: [0, 2, 4, 6]",
