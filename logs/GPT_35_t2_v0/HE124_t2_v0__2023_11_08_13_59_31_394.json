    "prompt": "For a given date string, write a function that checks whether the date is valid. A date is considered valid if it has a valid month and a valid number of days for its corresponding month, and if it has the format 'mm-dd-yyyy'. The function must receive a string as input and return a boolean.\n\nExample:\nInput: 03-11-2000\nLet's think step by step. First, we must determine whether the date is formatted correctly. Then if the format is correct, we must determine whether the date exists, by verifying the number of days in a month and whether the year is a leap year or not. In the example, '03-11-2000' follows the required 'mm-dd-yyyy' format. Additionally, March 11th of the year 2000 is an existing date. Therefore, '03-11-2000' is a valid date.\nOutput: True",
