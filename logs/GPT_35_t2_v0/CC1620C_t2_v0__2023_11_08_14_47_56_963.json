{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExample:\nInput: ['4', '3', 'a*']\nLet's think step by step. First, we must create a list of all possible strings we can obtain by replacing asterisks by 'b's from 0 to k times. Then, we must list these strings in lexicographically ascending order. Then, given x, we can find the x-th smallest BA-string. In the example, the strings we can obtain by replacing '*' with 'b' up to 4 times are: 'a', 'ab', 'abb', 'abbb' and 'abbbb', in lexicographically ascending order. Thus, the third smallest BA-string is 'abb'.\nOutput: abb", "response": "def generate_BA_strings(k, s):\n    asterisk_count = s.count('*')\n    BA_strings = []\n    \n    for i in range(asterisk_count + 1):\n        new_string = s.replace('*', 'b' * i)\n        BA_strings.append(new_string)\n    \n    BA_strings.sort()\n    \n    return BA_strings[x-1]\n\nk = 4\nx = 3\ns = 'a*'\n\ngenerate_BA_strings(k, s)"}
