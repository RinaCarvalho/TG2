    "prompt": "Let c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_n be a permutation of integers 1, 2, \u2026, n. Consider all subsegments of this permutation containing an integer x. Given an integer m, we call the integer x good if there are exactly m different values of maximum on these subsegments. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). A sequence a is a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Given four integers n, m, k and p, write a function to count the number of permutations of length n with exactly k good numbers, modulo p. The function must receive four integers n, m, k and p and return an integer.\n\nExample:\nInput: ['4', '3', '2', '10007']\nLet's think step by step. In the example, for n=4, take permutation [1, 3, 2, 4] for instance. For number 1, all subsegments containing it are: [1], [1, 3], [1, 3, 2] and [1, 3, 2, 4], and there are three different maxima: 1, 3 and 4. Similarly, for number 3, there are two different maxima 3 and 4. For number 2, there are three different maxima 2, 3 and 4. And for number 4, there is only one, which is 4 itself. Given m=3 and k=2, which corresponds to a permutation with 2 numbers having three different maxima each, the permutation [1, 3, 2, 4] should be included in our count, given numbers 1 and 2 have three different maxima each. Repeating this analysis for all permutations of numbers 1 to 4, we find that permutations [1, 3, 2, 4], [2, 3, 1, 4], [4, 1, 3, 2] and [4, 2, 3, 1] have 2 good numbers each, which brings us to a total of 4 permutations.\nOutput: 4",
