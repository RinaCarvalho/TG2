    "prompt": "For a given integer, write a function to set its leftmost unset bit. The function must receive an integer as input and return an integer.\n\nExample:\nInput: 10\nLet's think step by step. First, we must convert the input to a binary number. Then, we must locate the leftmost unset bit (0) in the binary string, and set it (change it to 1). Lastly, we must convert the binary number back to decimal. In the example, 10 (in decimal) is converted to b'1010' (in binary). Then, by setting the leftmost unset bit, we have b'1110'. Lastly, converting it back to decimal base, we have 14.\nOutput: 14",
    "response": "To solve this problem, follow these steps:\n1. Convert the input integer to a binary string using the built-in `bin()` function.\n2. Iterate over the binary string to find the first occurrence of '0'.\n3. Replace the '0' with '1' at that index.\n4. Convert the modified binary string back to an integer using the built-in `int()` function with a base of 2.\n5. Return the modified integer.\n\nHere's the code to accomplish this:\n\ndef set_leftmost_unset_bit(n):\n    binary = bin(n)[2:]  # convert to binary string, remove '0b' prefix\n    index = binary.find('0')  # find index of first '0' bit\n    modified_binary = binary[:index] + '1' + binary[index+1:]  # replace '0' with '1' at index\n    modified_integer = int(modified_binary, 2)  # convert binary string back to integer\n    return modified_integer",
