{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: 4 3 a*\nOutput: abb\n\nInput: 1 3 a**a\nOutput: abba\n\nInput: 3 20 **a***\nOutput: babbbbbbbbb", "response": "def lexicographically_smallest_bastring(k, x, s):\n    asterisk_counts = s.count('*')\n    b_counts = [0]*asterisk_counts\n    i = 0\n    while x > 0 and i < asterisk_counts:\n        if x > k:\n            b_counts[i] = k\n            x -= k\n        else:\n            b_counts[i] = x\n            x = 0\n        i += 1\n    result = ''\n    j = 0\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '*':\n            result += 'b'*b_counts[j]\n            j += 1\n        else:\n            result += c\n    return result"}
