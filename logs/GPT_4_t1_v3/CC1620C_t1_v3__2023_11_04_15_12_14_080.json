{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: 4 3 a*\nOutput: abb\n\nInput: 1 3 a**a\nOutput: abba\n\nInput: 3 20 **a***\nOutput: babbbbbbbbb", "response": "def ba_string(k, x, s):\n    p = [0] * (k + 1)\n    p[0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        p[i] = p[i - 1] * 2\n    s = list(s)\n    n = len(s)\n    for i in range(n):\n        if s[i] == '*':\n            for j in range(k + 1):\n                if p[n - i - 1] * (j + 1) >= x:\n                    s[i] = 'b' * j\n                    x = (x + j) // (j + 1)\n                    break\n    return ''.join(s)"}
