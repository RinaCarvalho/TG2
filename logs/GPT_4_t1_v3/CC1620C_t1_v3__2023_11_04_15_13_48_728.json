{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: 4 3 a*\nOutput: abb\n\nInput: 1 3 a**a\nOutput: abba\n\nInput: 3 20 **a***\nOutput: babbbbbbbbb", "response": "def find_ba_string(k, x, s):\n    asterisks = [0] * (len(s) + 1)\n    asterisks[-2] = 1\n    asterisks[-1] = 0\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    for i in range(len(s)-3, -1, -1):\n        if s[i] == '*':\n            asterisks[i] = asterisks[i+2] + (asterisks[i+1] * (k+1))\n        else:\n            asterisks[i] = asterisks[i+1]\n    \n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s):\n        if s[i] == 'a':\n            result += 'a'\n            i += 1\n            continue\n        \n        b = 0\n        while x > asterisks[i+1]:\n            x -= asterisks[i+1]\n            b += 1\n          \n        result += ('b' * b)\n        i += 2\n    return result"}
