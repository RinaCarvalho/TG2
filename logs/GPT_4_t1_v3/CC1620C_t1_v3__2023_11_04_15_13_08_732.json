{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: 4 3 a*\nOutput: abb\n\nInput: 1 3 a**a\nOutput: abba\n\nInput: 3 20 **a***\nOutput: babbbbbbbbb", "response": "def xth_smallest_ba_string(k, x, s):\n    asterisk_count = s.count('*')\n    total_count = len(s)\n    result = [0 for _ in range(total_count)]\n    total = 0\n\n    for i in range(total_count-1, -1, -1):\n        if s[i] == 'a':\n            result[i] = total\n        else:\n            limit = min(k+1, x-total)\n            j = 0\n            while j < limit:\n                total += [][]\n\n    smallest_ba_string = ''\n    for i in range(total_count):\n        smallest_ba_string += 'b' * result[i]\n        if i < len(s) and s[i] == 'a':\n            smallest_ba_string += 'a'\n    return smallest_ba_string"}
