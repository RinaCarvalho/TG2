{"prompt": "The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t. Write a function to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there are exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '100101011', '101']\nOutput: 1 1 0 1 6 -1 -1 -1\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '101101011', '111']\nOutput: 0 2 1 3 2 2 4 3", "response": "def min_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    prefix = [0]*(m+1)\n    i, j = 1, 0\n    while i < m:\n        if b[i] == b[j]:\n            j += 1\n            prefix[i] = j\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            if j != 0:\n                j = prefix[j-1]\n            else:\n                prefix[i] = 0\n                i += 1\n    dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n-m+2)]\n    inf = float('inf')\n    for i in range(m-1, n):\n        for j in range(i+2):\n            dp[j][i+1] = min(inf if j < m - prefix[m-j-1] else dp[j-m+prefix[m-j-1]][i-j]+b[:j].count('0')+a[i-j+1:i+1].count('1'), dp[j][i] if j <= i else inf)\n    return [min(dp[i][j] if i <= j else inf for j in range(n, m+i-2, -1)) if i < n-m+2 else -1 for i in range(n-m+2)]\n\nprint(min_changes(9, 3, '100101011', '101'))\nprint(min_changes(9, 3, '101101011', '111'))"}
