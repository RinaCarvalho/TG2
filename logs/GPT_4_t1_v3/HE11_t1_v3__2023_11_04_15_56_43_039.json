{"prompt": "For two given strings, consisting only of 0s and 1s, write a function that performs binary XOR on the inputs. The function must receive two strings as inputs and return a string.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['010', '110']\nOutput: 10\n\nInput: ['1', '0']\nOutput: 1", "response": "def binary_xor(s1,s2):\n    return ''.join(str(int(x)^int(y)) for x, y in zip(s1,s2))"}
