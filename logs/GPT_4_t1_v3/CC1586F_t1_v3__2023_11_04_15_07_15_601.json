    "prompt": "Consider a directed graph containing n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. There is a directed edge from node a to node b if and only if a < b. A path between nodes a and b is defined as a sequence of edges such that you can start at a, travel along all of these edges in the corresponding direction, and end at b. The length of a path is defined by the number of edges. A rainbow path of length x is defined as a path in the graph such that there exists at least 2 distinct colors among the set of x edges. Considering it is possible to label each edge with a color, write a function to determine the minimum number of colors needed to ensure that all paths of length k or longer are rainbow paths. The function must receive two integers, n and k, as inputs, and return an integer - the minimum number of colors needed.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: 5 3\nOutput: 2\n\nInput: 5 2\nOutput: 4",
    "response": "def minimum_colors(n, k):\n    return max(n-k+1, 2) if k > 1 else n\n\n# The function minimum_colors(n, k) calculates and returns the minimum number of colors needed so that all paths of length k or longer are rainbow paths in the given directed graph. The logic behind this algorithm is that we need at least two different colors for any path of k or longer length to be a rainbow path. However, if n-k+1 is larger than 2, we need n-k+1 different colors because each edge can be colored uniquely such that we have more variety of colors and thus creating more possibilities for rainbow paths. If k is equal to 1, all edges should be colored differently so we return n in that case.",
