    "prompt": "For a given list, write a function to flatten the list and add all of its elements. The function must receive a list as input and return a number.\n\nExample:\nInput: [1, 2, [3, 4]]\nLet's think step by step. First, we must check if there are any nested lists among the elements of the list. If there are any nested lists, we must iterate over the nested list, looking for other nested lists. This process must be repeated until no more nested lists are found. Then, all integers inside all nested lists must be added. In the example, first, we must check the list [3, 4]. Since there are no nested lists inside this list, we can add 3 + 4 = 7 as an intermediate result. Lastly, returning to the original list, since there are no additional lists, the sum of all elements must be 1 + 2 + 7 = 10.\nOutput: 10",
