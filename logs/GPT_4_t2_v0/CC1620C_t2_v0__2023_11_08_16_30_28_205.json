{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExample:\nInput: ['4', '3', 'a*']\nLet's think step by step. First, we must create a list of all possible strings we can obtain by replacing asterisks by 'b's from 0 to k times. Then, we must list these strings in lexicographically ascending order. Then, given x, we can find the x-th smallest BA-string. In the example, the strings we can obtain by replacing '*' with 'b' up to 4 times are: 'a', 'ab', 'abb', 'abbb' and 'abbbb', in lexicographically ascending order. Thus, the third smallest BA-string is 'abb'.\nOutput: abb", "response": "def BA_string(k, x, s):\n    from itertools import product\n    import heapq\n    replace_possibility = [\"b\" * i for i in range(k+1)]\n    s = list(s)\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if s[i] == \"*\":\n            s[i] = replace_possibility\n    possible_strings = list(product(*s))\n    all_strings = [''.join(item) for item in possible_strings]\n    heapq.heapify(all_strings)\n    for _ in range(x-1):\n        heapq.heappop(all_strings)\n    return heapq.heappop(all_strings)"}
