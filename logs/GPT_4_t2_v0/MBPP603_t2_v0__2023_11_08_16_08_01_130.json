    "prompt": "For a given integer n, write a function to get all ludic numbers smaller than or equal to n. The function must receive an integer as input and return a list of integers.\n\nExample:\nInput: 10\nLet's think step by step. First, we include 1 to the list of ludic numbers. Then, we must write a list of numbers starting from 2. The first number of the list (2) must be popped and included to the list of ludic numbers. Then, every 2nd number must be removed from the list. We then move on to the new first number of the list, 3. This number must be popped and included to the list of ludic numbers. Next, every 3rd number must be removed from the list. This process is then repeated until all ludic numbers smaller than or equal to n are found. In the example, we first include 1 to the list of ludic numbers. Then, we write a list of numbers starting from 2: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ...]. We pop 2 from the list, include it to the ludic numbers list and remove every 2nd number: [3, 5, 7, 9, ...]. We then pop 3 from the list, include it to the ludic numbers list, and remove every third number: [5, 7, ...]. Since n = 10, the last two ludic numbers smaller than 10 will be 5 and 7, leaving us with the list of ludic numbers: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7].\nOutput: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]",
