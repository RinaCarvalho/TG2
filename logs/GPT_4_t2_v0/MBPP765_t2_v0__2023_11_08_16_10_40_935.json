{"prompt": "For a given integer n, write a function to find the nth polite number. The function must receive an integer as input and return an integer.\n\nExample:\nInput: 7\nLet's think step by step. A polite number is a positive integer that can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive integers. As such, all numbers that aren't powers of 2 are polite numbers. In the example, the first 7 polite numbers are: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11. Thus, the 7th polite number is 11.\nOutput: 11", "response": "import math\n\ndef is_power_of_two(n):\n    return math.log2(n).is_integer()\n\ndef polite_number(n):\n    polite_numbers = []\n    i = 0\n    while len(polite_numbers) < n:\n        i += 1\n        if not is_power_of_two(i):\n            polite_numbers.append(i)\n    return polite_numbers[n-1]"}
