{"prompt": "The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t. Write a function to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there are exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.\n\nExample:\nInput: ['9', '3', '100101011', '101']\nLet's think step by step. Given m and n, we can determine k will range from 0 to n - m + 1. For each k, we must change 0s and 1s in the string a in order to have the substring b appear k times, and we wish to find the minimum number of changes in order to accomplish so. In the example, for k = 0, we wish for the substring '101' never to appear. This can be accomplished in one change by replacing the 6th character in our string a, so that it becomes '10010011'. For k = 1, only one change is needed in order for '101' to appear only once, and that can be to change a to '100001011'. For k = 2, no changes are needed, since '101' already appears twice. This process is repeated until k = n - m + 1, which yields the list of changes for each k: [1, 1, 0, 1, 6, -1, -1, -1].\nOutput: [1, 1, 0, 1, 6, -1, -1, -1]", "response": "def min_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    p = [0]*(n+1)\n    b = [int(bi) for bi in list(b)]\n    \n    for i in range(m-1, -1, -1):\n        p[i] = p[i+1]*2+b[i]\n\n    dp = [[10**9]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0]+int(a[i-1] == '1')\n\n    s = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        s = s*2+int(a[i-1])\n        if i >= m:\n            s &= (1<<m)-1\n        dp[i][i] = min(dp[i][i], dp[i-1][i-1]+bin(s^p[max(0, m-i-1)]).count('1'))\n        for j in range(min(i, n-m+2), 0, -1):\n            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j-1]+(a[i-1] != '1'))\n\n    ans = []\n    for k in range(n-m+2):\n        ans.append(dp[n][k] if dp[n][k] != 10**9 else -1)\n\n    return ans"}
