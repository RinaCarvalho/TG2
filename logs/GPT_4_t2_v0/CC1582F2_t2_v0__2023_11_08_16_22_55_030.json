{"prompt": "For a given array a of length n, write a function to find all integers x >= 0 such that there exists an increasing subsequence of the array a, in which the bitwise XOR of numbers is equal to x. A sequence s is a subsequence of a sequence b if s can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. A sequence s1, s2, ..., sm is called increasing if s1 < s2 < ... < sm. The function must receive a list with n integers a1, a2, ..., an - the elements of the array a. The function must return a list of integers x1, x2, ..., xk, in increasing order - the found x values.\n\nExample:\nInput: ['4', '2', '2', '4']\nLet's think step by step. First, we must determine the largest possible bitwise XOR that can be obtained from an increasing subsequence of the array a. Then for each integer x ranging from 0 to this result, we must test whether there is an increasing subsequence of the array a whose bitwise XOR of its elements is equal to x, and, if so, add it to a list to be returned. In the example, for x = 0, it is possible to choose the empty subsequence []. For x = 2, it is possible to choose the subsequence [2]. For x = 4, we can choose the subsequence [4]. Lastly, for x = 6, we can choose subsequence [2, 4], given that 2 ^ 4 = b'10' ^ b'100' = b'110' = 6. Therefore, we end up with the list [0, 2, 4, 6].\nOutput: [0, 2, 4, 6]", "response": "def find_bitwise_XORs(arr):\n    # Finding the maximum element of array\n    max_ele = max(arr)\n\n    # Finding the maximum bitwise XOR that can be generated\n    max_xor = 0\n    for num in arr:\n        max_xor |= num\n\n    # Set to store the bitwise XOR\n    xor_set = set()\n\n    # Loop for all elements from 0 to maximum bitwise XOR\n    for i in range(max_xor + 1):\n        # Set to store the prefix XOR\n        prefix_XORs = {0}\n\n        # Loop for all elements in array\n        for num in arr:\n            # Adding current number to all prefix XORs\n            new_XORs = {num ^ x for x in prefix_XORs}\n\n            # If the generated XOR is equal to the current number,\n            # then add it to the XOR set\n            if i in new_XORs:\n                xor_set.add(i)\n\n            # Add the new XORs to prefix XORs\n            prefix_XORs.update(new_XORs)\n\n    # Return the sorted list of unique XORs\n    return sorted(list(xor_set))"}
