{"prompt": "For a given integer n, write a function to find the nth polite number. The function must receive an integer as input and return an integer.\n\nExample:\nInput: 7\nLet's think step by step. A polite number is a positive integer that can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive integers. As such, all numbers that aren't powers of 2 are polite numbers. In the example, the first 7 polite numbers are: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11. Thus, the 7th polite number is 11.\nOutput: 11", "response": "def find_polite_number(n):\n    count = 0\n    i = 1\n    while count < n:\n        if (i & (i - 1)) != 0:  # check if i is not a power of 2\n            count += 1\n        i += 1\n    return i - 1\n"}
