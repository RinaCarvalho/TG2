{"prompt": "Let c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_n be a permutation of integers 1, 2, \u2026, n. Consider all subsegments of this permutation containing an integer x. Given an integer m, we call the integer x good if there are exactly m different values of maximum on these subsegments. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). A sequence a is a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Given four integers n, m, k and p, write a function to count the number of permutations of length n with exactly k good numbers, modulo p. The function must receive four integers n, m, k and p and return an integer.\n\nExample:\nInput: ['4', '3', '2', '10007']\nLet's think step by step. In the example, for n=4, take permutation [1, 3, 2, 4] for instance. For number 1, all subsegments containing it are: [1], [1, 3], [1, 3, 2] and [1, 3, 2, 4], and there are three different maxima: 1, 3 and 4. Similarly, for number 3, there are two different maxima 3 and 4. For number 2, there are three different maxima 2, 3 and 4. And for number 4, there is only one, which is 4 itself. Given m=3 and k=2, which corresponds to a permutation with 2 numbers having three different maxima each, the permutation [1, 3, 2, 4] should be included in our count, given numbers 1 and 2 have three different maxima each. Repeating this analysis for all permutations of numbers 1 to 4, we find that permutations [1, 3, 2, 4], [2, 3, 1, 4], [4, 1, 3, 2] and [4, 2, 3, 1] have 2 good numbers each, which brings us to a total of 4 permutations.\nOutput: 4", "response": "def count_permutations(n, m, k, p):\n\n    COMB = [[0]*5001 for _ in range(5001)]\n    F = [[0]*5001 for _ in range(5001)]\n    G = [[0]*5001 for _ in range(5001)]\n    F2 = [[0]*5001 for _ in range(5001)]\n    G2 = [[0]*5001 for _ in range(5001)]\n    fac = [0]*5001\n    pow_m_minus_1 = [0]*5001\n    COMB[0][0] = 1\n\n    for i in range(1, 5001):\n        COMB[i][0] = 1\n        for j in range(1, i+1):\n            COMB[i][j] = (COMB[i-1][j] + COMB[i-1][j-1]) % p\n\n    fac[0] = 1\n    pow_m_minus_1[0] = 1\n    x = 1\n    for m_minus_1 in range(1, m):\n        x = (x*m_minus_1) % p\n    pow_m_minus_1[m-1] = x\n\n    for i in range(1, 5001):\n        fac[i] = (i * fac[i-1]) % p\n        if i >= m:\n            pow_m_minus_1[i] = (pow_m_minus_1[i-1] * m) % p\n\n    F[0][0] = 1\n    for n_minus_1 in range(0, n):\n        for k in range(0, min(n_minus_1+1, k+1)):\n            F[n_minus_1+1][k+1] = (F[n_minus_1+1][k+1] + F[n_minus_1][k]*pow_m_minus_1[m-1]) % p\n            F[n_minus_1+1][k] = (F[n_minus_1+1][k] + F[n_minus_1][k]*(n_minus_1+1-k)) % p\n            F2[n_minus_1+1][k+1] = (F2[n_minus_1+1][k+1] + F2[n_minus_1][k]*pow_m_minus_1[m-1]) % p\n            F2[n_minus_1+1][k] = (F2[n_minus_1+1][k] + F2[n_minus_1][k]*(n_minus_1+1-k)) % p\n            F2[n_minus_1+1][k] = (F2[n_minus_1+1][k] + F[n_minus_1][k]*COMB[n][k]*(m-1)) % p\n\n    G[n][k] = F[n][k]\n    for n_minus_1 in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        for k in range(0, min(n_minus_1+1, k+1)):\n            G[n_minus_1][k] = F[n_minus_1][k]\n            G[n_minus_1][k] = (G[n_minus_1][k] + G[n_minus_1+1][k+1]*(n_minus_1+1)) % p\n            G2[n_minus_1][k] = F2[n_minus_1][k]\n            G2[n_minus_1][k] = (G2[n_minus_1][k] + G2[n_minus_1+1][k+1]*(n_minus_1+1)) % p\n\n    return (G2[0][0] - (G[0][0] * COMB[n][k]) % p + p) % p"}
