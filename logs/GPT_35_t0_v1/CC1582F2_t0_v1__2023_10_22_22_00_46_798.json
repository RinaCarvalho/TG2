A sequence s is a  sunbsequ ence o f asequence b if s can be obtained from b by deletion of several (p osibly, zeero or all) elemenst. A sequence s1, s2, .., sm is called incr esing if s1 < s2 < ... < sm. The function must receive a list wrh n integers a1, a2, ..., an - the elements of the aray a. The functtion must return a list of integers x1,x2, .., xk,in increasing order - thefound xx values.",
