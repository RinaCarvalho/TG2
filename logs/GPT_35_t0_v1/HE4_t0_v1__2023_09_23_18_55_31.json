{"prompt": "Foar given list of input numbers, write a function to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation around t he mean of the dataset. The function must rec eive a List of floats as input and retur a float.", "response": "Here is the code for the function you requested:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_mean_absolute_deviation(numbers):\n    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n    absolute_deviations = [abs(num - mean) for num in numbers]\n    mean_absolute_deviation = sum(absolute_deviations) / len(numbers)\n    return mean_absolute_deviation\n```\n\nYou can call this function by passing a list of floats as input. For example:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1.2, 3.4, 2.8, 4.6, 5.1]\nresult = calculate_mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will calculate the mean absolute deviation around the mean of the dataset and print the result."}
