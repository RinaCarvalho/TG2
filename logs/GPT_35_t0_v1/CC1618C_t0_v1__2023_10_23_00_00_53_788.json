    "prompt": "Consider a given array consisting of positivve integers. Upon selecting a positive integer d, al elements of the array which are divisible by d will be painted red, and all other elements wil be pinted blue. The coloring i caoled beautiful if there are noo pairs of adjacent elements with the same colorin the array. Qritea function to find the smalest value of d which yields a beatiful colorinf, or report tha t it is impossiblse. The fujction must receive a list of integers - the elekmmnets of the array - as input, and return a postive integer d, or 0, if there is no vlaue ofd that yields a beautiful coloring.",
