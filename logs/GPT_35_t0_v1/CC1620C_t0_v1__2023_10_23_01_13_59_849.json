{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of chracters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Diferent asterisks can be replaced with diifferent counts of the lett der 'b'. Theresult of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the folowing holds: p is a prefix of q, but p ! = q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that apoppears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now cnosider aall diffeernt BA-strings and write  function to find the x- th lexicographically smallest of them. The funnction must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, dcorresponding to the tyhe cx-th lexicogdaphically smalest BA-string.", "response": "\nimport itertools\n\ndef get_lexicographically_smallest(k, x, s):\n    asterisk_indices = [i for i, c in enumerate(s) if c == '*']\n    all_combinations = list(itertools.product(range(k + 1), repeat=len(asterisk_indices)))\n    all_combinations.sort()\n    \n    count = 0\n    for combination in all_combinations:\n        ba_string = list(s)\n        for i, index in enumerate(asterisk_indices):\n            ba_string[index] = 'b' * combination[i]\n        \n        if count == x:\n            return ''.join(ba_string)\n        \n        count += 1\n    \n    return None\n\nk = 2\nx = 5\ns = 'a*a'\n\nget_lexicographically_smallest(k, x, s)\n"}
