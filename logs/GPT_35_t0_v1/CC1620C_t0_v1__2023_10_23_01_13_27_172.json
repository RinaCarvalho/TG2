{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of chracters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Diferent asterisks can be replaced with diifferent counts of the lett der 'b'. Theresult of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the folowing holds: p is a prefix of q, but p ! = q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that apoppears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now cnosider aall diffeernt BA-strings and write  function to find the x- th lexicographically smallest of them. The funnction must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, dcorresponding to the tyhe cx-th lexicogdaphically smalest BA-string.", "response": "def find_xth_BA_string(k, x, s):\n    def generate_BA_strings(curr_string, remaining_stars):\n        if len(curr_string) == len(s):\n            all_BA_strings.append(curr_string)\n            return\n        if s[len(curr_string)] == 'a':\n            generate_BA_strings(curr_string + 'a', remaining_stars)\n        else:\n            for i in range(remaining_stars + 1):\n                generate_BA_strings(curr_string + 'b'*i, remaining_stars - i)\n    all_BA_strings = []\n    generate_BA_strings('', k)\n    all_BA_strings.sort()\n    return all_BA_strings[x-1]"}
