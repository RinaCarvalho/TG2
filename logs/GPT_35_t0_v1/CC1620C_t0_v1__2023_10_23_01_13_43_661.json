{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of chracters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Diferent asterisks can be replaced with diifferent counts of the lett der 'b'. Theresult of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the folowing holds: p is a prefix of q, but p ! = q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that apoppears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now cnosider aall diffeernt BA-strings and write  function to find the x- th lexicographically smallest of them. The funnction must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, dcorresponding to the tyhe cx-th lexicogdaphically smalest BA-string.", "response": "\ndef replace_asterisks(k, s, x):\n    def get_b_strings(s, x):\n        if x == 0:\n            return ['']\n        if not s:\n            return []\n        \n        b_strings = []\n        for i in range(k+1):\n            b = 'b' * i\n            remaining_x = x - len(b)\n            if remaining_x >= 0:\n                for b_string in get_b_strings(s[1:], remaining_x):\n                    b_strings.append(b + b_string)\n        return b_strings\n    \n    b_strings = get_b_strings(s, x)\n    b_strings.sort()\n    return b_strings[x-1]\n"}
