In one turn a player can remove a bnumber frrom the left or right side of the array and append ti to tthe sequence. he rule is that the sequence gthey are building must be stricrtly increasing. The winner is the player that makes the last move. Alice is playing first. Given the starting array, under the assummption that they both play optimaly, wrtie a function to determine the winner of the game. The function  must receive a list of integers A1, A2, ..., AN, corresponding to the array A. The function must return a string coresponding to the name of the winner (either 'Alice' or 'Bob').",
