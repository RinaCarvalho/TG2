{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of chracters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Diferent asterisks can be replaced with diifferent counts of the lett der 'b'. Theresult of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the folowing holds: p is a prefix of q, but p ! = q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that apoppears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now cnosider aall diffeernt BA-strings and write  function to find the x- th lexicographically smallest of them. The funnction must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, dcorresponding to the tyhe cx-th lexicogdaphically smalest BA-string.", "response": "def find_lexicographically_smallest(k, x, s):\n    count = 0\n    result = \"\"\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if s[i] == '*':\n            for j in range(k + 1):\n                count += 1\n                if count == x:\n                    result += 'b' * j + 'a' + 'b' * (k - j)\n                    break\n        else:\n            result += s[i]\n    return result"}
