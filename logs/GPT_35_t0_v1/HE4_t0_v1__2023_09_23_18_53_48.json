{"prompt": "For a given list of input numbers, write a function to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of the dataset. The function must receive a List of floats as input and retu rn a float.", "response": "Here is the code for the requested function:\n\n```python\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers):\n    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n    deviations = [abs(num - mean) for num in numbers]\n    mean_absolute_deviation = sum(deviations) / len(deviations)\n    return mean_absolute_deviation\n```"}
