Diferent asterisks can be replaced with diifferent counts of the lett der 'b'. Theresult of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the folowing holds: p is a prefix of q, but p ! = q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that apoppears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now cnosider aall diffeernt BA-strings and write  function to find the x- th lexicographically smallest of them. The funnction must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, dcorresponding to the tyhe cx-th lexicogdaphically smalest BA-string.",
