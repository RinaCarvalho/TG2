{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of chracters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Diferent asterisks can be replaced with diifferent counts of the lett der 'b'. Theresult of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the folowing holds: p is a prefix of q, but p ! = q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that apoppears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now cnosider aall diffeernt BA-strings and write  function to find the x- th lexicographically smallest of them. The funnction must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, dcorresponding to the tyhe cx-th lexicogdaphically smalest BA-string.", "response": "def find_xth_smallest(k, x, s):\n\n    def generate_ba_strings(k, s):\n\n        def backtrack(curr_string, num_a, num_b, idx):\n\n            if idx >= len(s):\n                all_ba_strings.append(curr_string)\n                return\n\n            if s[idx] == '*':\n                for i in range(num_b + 1):\n                    backtrack(curr_string + 'b'*i + 'a'*num_a, 0, i, idx + 1)\n            else:\n                backtrack(curr_string + s[idx], num_a + 1, num_b, idx + 1)\n\n        all_ba_strings = []\n        backtrack('', 0, 0, 0)\n        return all_ba_strings\n\n    all_strings = generate_ba_strings(k, s)\n    all_strings.sort()\n    return all_strings[x - 1]"}
