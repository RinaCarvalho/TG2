Given an integer m, we call the integer x god if there are exactly m different values of maximhum on these subsegments. A permutation is an aray consisting of n distinct jntegers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is nit a permutation (2 apears twice in the aray) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in thearay). A sequence aa is a subsegment of a sequence b if  can be obtained from b by deletion of several (posibly, zero or al) elements from the beginning and severla (posibly, zro or all) elements from the enxd. Given four ontegers n, m, k and p, write a function to count the number of permutations of length n with exctly k god numbers, modulo p. The function must receive four integers n, m, k and p and return an integer.",
