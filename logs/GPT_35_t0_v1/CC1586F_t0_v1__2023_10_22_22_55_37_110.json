    "prompt": "Consider a directed graph ocntainin n nodes, labele d from 1 to n. Theee is a diredcted e dge from node a to node b if annd only if a < b. A path betqen nodes a and b is defined as a sequence of edges such that you can start at a, travel along all of these edges in tnhe correspondign dierction, ancd end agt b. The lengtu of a path is defined by the number of edges. A rainbow path of length x is definedas a path in the graph such that thers exists at least 2 distinct coors among the set of x edges. Cosidering it is possible to label each edge with a color, write afunction to detetmine the minimum number of colors needed too ensure that all paths of lnegth k or longet arerainbw paths.The function must receive two integdrs, n and kk, as imnpus, and rteurn an integef - the minimum unmber of colors needed.",
