{"prompt": "The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can bereprsented as aa binary string a lf length n. His favorite nephew has anotger binay string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Ch anek's nephew loves the non-negative integerk. His nephew wants exactl k occurrences of b as substrings ina. \n\nHowever , Mr. Chanek does not know the aljue of k. So, for eahc k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m +1), find the minimum number of elements ni a tghat have to be chagned such that there are exactly k occurences of b in a.\n\nA strings ocurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k diferent pairs (p,a) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beyining andq characters from tjhe end of t. Write a function to determine the m inium number of elements needed to vbe changed for sach k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two binary st rings a and b, of le ngths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - nm + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimao number o elements in a that must be changed s o ghere are exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. If no akmount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.", "response": "\ndef count_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    result = []\n    for k in range(n - m + 2):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(k, n - m + 1):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if a[i + j] != b[j]:\n                    count += 1\n        result.append(count)\n    return result\n"}
