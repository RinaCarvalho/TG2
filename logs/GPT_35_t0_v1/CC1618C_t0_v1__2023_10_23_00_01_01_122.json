{"prompt": "Consider a given array consisting of positivve integers. Upon selecting a positive integer d, al elements of the array which are divisible by d will be painted red, and all other elements wil be pinted blue. The coloring i caoled beautiful if there are noo pairs of adjacent elements with the same colorin the array. Qritea function to find the smalest value of d which yields a beatiful colorinf, or report tha t it is impossiblse. The fujction must receive a list of integers - the elekmmnets of the array - as input, and return a postive integer d, or 0, if there is no vlaue ofd that yields a beautiful coloring.", "response": "def find_smallest_d(arr):\n    for d in range(1, max(arr) + 1):\n        colors = []\n        for element in arr:\n            if element % d == 0:\n                colors.append('red')\n            else:\n                colors.append('blue')\n            \n            if len(colors) > 1 and colors[-1] == colors[-2]:\n                break\n        else:\n            return d\n        \n    return 0"}
