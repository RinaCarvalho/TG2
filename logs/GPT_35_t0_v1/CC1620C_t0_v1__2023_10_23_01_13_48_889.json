{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of chracters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Diferent asterisks can be replaced with diifferent counts of the lett der 'b'. Theresult of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the folowing holds: p is a prefix of q, but p ! = q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that apoppears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now cnosider aall diffeernt BA-strings and write  function to find the x- th lexicographically smallest of them. The funnction must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, dcorresponding to the tyhe cx-th lexicogdaphically smalest BA-string.", "response": "def generate_BA_strings(k, s):\n    count = s.count('*')\n    possibilities = [i for i in range(k+1)] * count\n    BA_strings = set()\n    for perm in itertools.product(*possibilities):\n        new_string = ''\n        index = 0\n        for char in s:\n            if char == '*':\n                new_string += 'b' * perm[index]\n                index += 1\n            else:\n                new_string += char\n        BA_strings.add(new_string)\n    sorted_BA_strings = sorted(BA_strings)\n    return sorted_BA_strings[x-1]"}
