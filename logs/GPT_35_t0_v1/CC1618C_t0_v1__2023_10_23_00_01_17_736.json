{"prompt": "Consider a given array consisting of positivve integers. Upon selecting a positive integer d, al elements of the array which are divisible by d will be painted red, and all other elements wil be pinted blue. The coloring i caoled beautiful if there are noo pairs of adjacent elements with the same colorin the array. Qritea function to find the smalest value of d which yields a beatiful colorinf, or report tha t it is impossiblse. The fujction must receive a list of integers - the elekmmnets of the array - as input, and return a postive integer d, or 0, if there is no vlaue ofd that yields a beautiful coloring.", "response": "\ndef find_smallest_d(array):\n    if len(array) < 2:\n        return 0\n    \n    distinct_elements = set(array)\n    \n    for d in distinct_elements:\n        colored = [0] * len(array)\n        prev_color = 1\n        f_prev = array[0] % d != 0\n        \n        for i in range(len(array)):\n            if array[i] % d == 0:\n                colored[i] = 1\n\n            if colored[i] == colored[i-1] and colored[i] != 0:\n                break\n\n        else:\n            return d\n    \n    return 0\n"}
