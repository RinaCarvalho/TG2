{"prompt": "Consider a given array consisting of positivve integers. Upon selecting a positive integer d, al elements of the array which are divisible by d will be painted red, and all other elements wil be pinted blue. The coloring i caoled beautiful if there are noo pairs of adjacent elements with the same colorin the array. Qritea function to find the smalest value of d which yields a beatiful colorinf, or report tha t it is impossiblse. The fujction must receive a list of integers - the elekmmnets of the array - as input, and return a postive integer d, or 0, if there is no vlaue ofd that yields a beautiful coloring.", "response": "\ndef find_smallest_value(array):\n    for d in range(1, min(array) + 1):\n        coloring = [i % d == 0 for i in array]\n        if all(coloring[i] != coloring[i+1] for i in range(len(coloring)-1)):\n            return d\n    return 0\n"}
