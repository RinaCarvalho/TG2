{"prompt": "The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t. Write a function to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there are exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '100101011', '101']\nOutput: [1, 1, 0, 1, 6, -1, -1, -1]\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '101101011', '111']\nOutput: [0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 3]", "response": "\ndef min_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    nb = [0]*(n+1)\n    dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        if a[i:i+m] == b:\n            nb[i] = nb[i+1] + 1\n        else:\n            nb[i] = nb[i+1]\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + (a[i-1] == '1')\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(1, i+1):\n            if i < m and j == 1:\n                dp[i][j] = -1\n            elif a[i-m:i] != b:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + (a[i-1] == '1')\n            elif nb[i-m]+1 < j:\n                dp[i][j] = -1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j] + (a[i-1] == '1'), dp[i-m][j-1] + sum(x != y for x, y in zip(a[i-m:i], b)))\n            if dp[i][j] != -1 and nb[i-1] + 1 < j:\n                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j-1] + (a[i-1] == '1'))\n    res = []\n    for i in range(n-m+2):\n        res.append(dp[n][i] if nb[0] >= i else -1)\n    return res\n"}
