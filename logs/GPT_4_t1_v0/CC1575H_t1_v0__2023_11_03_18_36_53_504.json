{"prompt": "The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t. Write a function to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there are exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '100101011', '101']\nOutput: [1, 1, 0, 1, 6, -1, -1, -1]\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '101101011', '111']\nOutput: [0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 3]", "response": "def change_elements(n, m, a, b):\n    n = int(n)\n    m = int(m)\n    d = [[[int(0) for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for i in range(n+1):\n        for j in range(n+1):\n            for k in range(n+1):\n                d[i][j][k] = n\n    d[0][0][0] = int(0)\n    for i in range(n):\n        d[i+1][0][0] = d[i][0][0] + (a[i] != '0')\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1):\n            for k in range(min(j, n-m+1)+1):\n                d[i+1][j+1][k] = min(d[i+1][j+1][k], d[i][j][k] + (a[i] != '1'), d[i][j+1][k-1] + (a[i] != b[i-j]) if k > 0 else n)\n    out = [0 for _ in range(n-m+2)]\n    for k in range(n-m+2):\n        out[k] = min(d[i][i][k] if i >= k else n for i in range(k, n+1)) if k <= n else n\n    for i in range(n-m+2):\n        if out[i] == n:\n            out[i] = -1\n    return out"}
