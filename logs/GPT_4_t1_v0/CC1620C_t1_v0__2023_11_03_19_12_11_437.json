{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['4', '3', 'a*']\nOutput: abb\n\nInput: ['1', '3', 'a**a']\nOutput: abba\n\nInput: ['3', '20', '**a***']\nOutput: babbbbbbbbb", "response": "def nth_ba_string(k, x, s):\n    s = list(s)\n    asterisk_positions = [i for i, c in enumerate(s) if c == '*']\n    n = len(asterisk_positions)\n    for i in range(n):\n        low, high = 0, k\n        while low < high:\n            mid = (low + high + 1) // 2\n            if mid * (k + 1) ** (n - i - 1) < x:\n                low = mid\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n        s[asterisk_positions[i]] = 'b' * low\n        x -= low * (k + 1) ** (n - i - 1)\n    return ''.join(s)\n"}
