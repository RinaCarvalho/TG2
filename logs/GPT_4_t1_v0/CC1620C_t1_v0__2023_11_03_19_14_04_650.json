{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['4', '3', 'a*']\nOutput: abb\n\nInput: ['1', '3', 'a**a']\nOutput: abba\n\nInput: ['3', '20', '**a***']\nOutput: babbbbbbbbb", "response": "def get_ba_string(k, x, s):\n    dp = [[0]*(len(s)+1) for _ in range(k+1)]\n    dp[k][len(s)] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(len(s)-1, -1, -1):\n        dp[k][i] = dp[k][i+1]\n        if s[i] == '*':\n            dp[k][i] += dp[k][i+1]*k\n            for j in range(k-1, -1, -1):\n                dp[j][i] = dp[j+1][i]\n    \n    result = ''\n    cnta = s.count('a')\n    cntstar = len(s) - cnta\n    \n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if s[i] == '*':\n            cntstar -= 1\n        # choose 'a'\n        if x <= dp[k-1][i+1]*((k**cntstar)*(cnta**(cnta>0))):\n            result += 'a'*(s[i]=='a')+ 'b'*(s[i]=='*')\n            if s[i] == 'a':\n                cnta -= 1\n        # choose 'b'\n        else:\n            x -= dp[k-1][i+1]*((k**cntstar)*(cnta**(cnta>0)))\n            result += 'b'\n    return result"}
