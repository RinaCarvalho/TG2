{"prompt": "The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t. Write a function to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there are exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '100101011', '101']\nOutput: [1, 1, 0, 1, 6, -1, -1, -1]\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '101101011', '111']\nOutput: [0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 3]", "response": "def min_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    dp = [[0 for _ in range(m+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    prefix = [0 for _ in range(n+1)]\n    answer = [float('inf') for _ in range(n-m+2)]\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + (a[i - 1] == '1')\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        dp[i][0] = prefix[i]\n    for i in range(1, m+1):\n        dp[i-1][i] = float('inf')\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(1, min(i+1, m+1)):\n            if a[i - 1] == b[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j] + 2)\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 2, dp[i - 1][j])\n    for i in range(m, n + 1):\n        for j in range(i-m+1):\n            answer[j] = min(answer[j], dp[i-j][m] + prefix[i-m] - prefix[j])\n    return [a if a != float('inf') else -1 for a in answer]\n\nprint(min_changes(9, 3, '100101011', '101'))\nprint(min_changes(9, 3, '101101011', '111'))"}
