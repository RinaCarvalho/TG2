{"prompt": "For two given integers l and n, write a function to calculate the area of a regular polygon with l as the length of its sides and n as the number of its sides. The function must receive two integers as inputs and return a number with three precision points.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['20', '4']\nOutput: 400.000\n\nInput: ['15', '10']\nOutput: 1731.197", "response": "import math\n\ndef polygon_area(l, n):\n    area  = 0.25*n*l*l/(math.tan(math.pi/n))\n    rounded_area = round(area, 3)\n    return rounded_area"}
