{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['4', '3', 'a*']\nOutput: abb\n\nInput: ['1', '3', 'a**a']\nOutput: abba\n\nInput: ['3', '20', '**a***']\nOutput: babbbbbbbbb", "response": "def find_ba_string(k, x, s):\n    n = s.count('*')\n    dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        dp[i][0] = 1\n        for j in range(1, i+1):\n            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]*(k+1)\n    res = []\n    cnt = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch == 'a':\n            res.append('a')\n        else:\n            cnt += 1\n            for i in range(k+1):\n                if dp[n-cnt][cnt-1] < x:\n                    x -= dp[n-cnt][cnt-1]\n                else:\n                    res.append('b'*i)\n                    break\n    return ''.join(res)"}
