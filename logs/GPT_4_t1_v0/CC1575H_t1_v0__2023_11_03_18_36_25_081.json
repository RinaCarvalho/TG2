{"prompt": "The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t. Write a function to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there are exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '100101011', '101']\nOutput: [1, 1, 0, 1, 6, -1, -1, -1]\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '101101011', '111']\nOutput: [0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 3]", "response": "def min_changes(n, m, a, b):\n    sz, msk = 100, 1\n    dp, ad = [[[0 for _ in range(2)] for _ in range(m + 2)] for _ in range(sz + 1)], [0 for _ in range(sz + 2)]\n    bp, ans = [[0 for _ in range(2)] for _ in range(m + 2)], [0 for _ in range(n - m + 2)]\n\n    for i in range(1, n - m + 2):\n        ans[i] = -1\n\n    for i in range(sz + 1):\n        dp[i][0][0] = i\n\n    b = '0' + b\n    for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n        if i > n - m + 1:\n            dp[i][m][1] = dp[i - 1][m - 1][1] + (a[i] != b[m]), dp[i][m][1] = dp[i - 1][m][0] + (a[i] != b[m])\n        else:\n            dp[i][m][1] = min(dp[i - 1][m - 1][1] + (a[i] != b[m]), dp[i - 1][m][0] + (a[i] != b[m]))\n            for j in range(m - 1, 0, -1):\n                dp[i][j][0] = min(dp[i - 1][j][0] + (a[i] != b[j]), ad[i - 1] + m - j)\n                dp[i][j][1] = min(dp[i - 1][j - 1][1] + (a[i] != b[j]), dp[i - 1][j][0] + (a[i] != b[j]))\n\n            dp[i][0][0] = min(dp[i - 1][0][0] + a[i], ad[i - 1] + m)\n            bp[i][0] = bp[i - 1][0] + (a[i] == '1'), bp[i][m] = min(bp[i][m], bp[i - 1][m] + 1)\n\n            if dp[i][m][1] <= ad[i - 1]:\n                ad[i] = dp[i][m][1]\n                bp[i][m] = bp[i - 1][m] + 1\n            else:\n                ad[i] = ad[i - 1]\n                bp[i][m] = bp[i - 1][m]\n\n            ans[bp[i][m]] = min(ans[bp[i][m]], ad[i] if ans[bp[i][m]] == -1 else ad[i])\n\n    return ans[:-1]"}
