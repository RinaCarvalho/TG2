{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['4', '3', 'a*']\nOutput: abb\n\nInput: ['1', '3', 'a**a']\nOutput: abba\n\nInput: ['3', '20', '**a***']\nOutput: babbbbbbbbb", "response": "\ndef find_ba_string(k, x, s):\n    n, m = len(s), s.count('*')\n    c, d, f = [0]*(n+1), [0]*(n+1), [1]*(n+1)\n    \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        c[i] = c[i-1] + (s[i-1] == '*')\n        f[i] = min(f[i-1]*(k+1), x+1)\n\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        if s[i] == '*':\n            y = min((x-1)//f[i], k)\n            d[i] = y\n            x -= y*f[i]\n    \n    result = ['b']*d[0] + ['a']*(s[0] == 'a')\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        result += ['b']*(d[i] - d[i-1]) + ['a']*(s[i] == 'a')\n    \n    return ''.join(result)\n"}
