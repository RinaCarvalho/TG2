{"prompt": "Given an itneger k and astring s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically sm aller tyhan q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different A-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographidcally smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and astring s. The funcrion must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to te  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nUnput: ['4', '3', 'a*']\nOutput: abb\n\nInput: ['1', '3', 'a**a']\nOutput: abba\n\nInput: ['3', '20', '**a***']\nOutput: babbbbbbbbb", "response": "def find_xth_smallest(k, x, s):\n    def generate_ba_string(s):\n        count = 0\n        ba_string = ''\n        for c in s:\n            if c == 'a':\n                ba_string += 'a'\n                count = 0\n            elif c == '*':\n                count += 1\n                if count <= k:\n                    ba_string += 'b' * count\n        return ba_string\n    \n    all_strings = set()\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(2**s.count('*')):\n        ba_string = generate_ba_string(s)\n        if count == x:\n            return ba_string\n        all_strings.add(ba_string)\n        count += 1\n        \n        reversed_s = s[::-1]\n        for j in range(len(reversed_s)):\n            if reversed_s[j] == '*':\n                if (i >> j) & 1:\n                    s = s[:len(s)-j-1] + 'a' + s[len(s)-j:]\n                    break\n                else:\n                    s = s[:len(s)-j-1] + '*' + s[len(s)-j:]\n    \n    return ''\n\n\nprint(find_xth_smallest(4, 3, 'a*'))\nprint(find_xth_smallest(1, 3, 'a**a'))\nprint(find_xth_smallest(3, 20, '**a***'))"}
