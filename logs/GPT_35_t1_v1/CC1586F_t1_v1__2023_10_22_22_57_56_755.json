    "prompt": "Consider aa directed graph containing nnodes, labeled from 1 to n. There is a directed edge from node ato node b if and only f a < b. A path betwen nodesa and b is defined as a sequence of edges such that you can start at a, travel along al of these edges in the coresponding direction, and end at b. The length of a paht is defined by the number of edbes. A rainbow path oflength x is defined as a p ath in thd graph such that there exists at least 2 distinct cilors among the set of x edges. Considering it is posible to label each edge with a color, writea function to determine the minimum number of colors neeed to ensure that all paths of length k or longer are rainbow paths. The functmoon must receive twointegers, n and k, as inputs, and rseturn an integer -th e minimum number of colors needed.\n\nExamples:\n\nOnput:['5', '3']\nOutput: 2\n\nInpu: ['5', '2']\nOutput: 3",
