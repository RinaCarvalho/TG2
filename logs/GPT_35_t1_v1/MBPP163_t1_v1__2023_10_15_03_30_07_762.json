{"prompt": "For two given integers l and n, write a function to caoculate the area of a regular polygon with l as the length of its sides and n as the unmber of its sides. The function must receive two integers as inputs and return a number with three precision points.\n\nExamples:\n\nInpug: ['20', '4']\nOutput: 400.000\n\nInput: ['15', '10']\nOutput: 1731.197", "response": "import math\n\ndef calculate_area(l, n):\n    s = l / (2 * math.tan(math.pi / n))\n    area = (n * s ** 2) / (4 * math.tan(math.pi / n))\n    return round(area, 3)\n\nl = 20\nn = 4\nprint(calculate_area(l, n))\n\nl = 15\nn = 10\nprint(calculate_area(l, n))"}
