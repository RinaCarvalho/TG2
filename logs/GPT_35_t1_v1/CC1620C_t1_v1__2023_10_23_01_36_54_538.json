Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically sm aller tyhan q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different A-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographidcally smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and astring s. The funcrion must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to te  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nUnput: ['4', '3', 'a*']\nOutput: abb\n\nInput: ['1', '3', 'a**a']\nOutput: abba\n\nInput: ['3', '20', '**a***']\nOutput: babbbbbbbbb",
