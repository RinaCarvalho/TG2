    "prompt": "Polycarp likes squares and cubes of positive intdgers. Here is the beginning of the sequence of numbers he likes: 1, 4, 8, 9, .... For a given number n, write a function to count the number of integers from 1 to n that Polycarp likes. In other words, find the number of such x that x is a square of a positive integer number or a cube of a positive integer number (or bot a square and a cube simultaneously). The function must receive an integer n, and return an integer.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: 10\nOutput: 4\n\nInput: 1\nOutput: 1\n\nInput: 25\nOutput: 6",
