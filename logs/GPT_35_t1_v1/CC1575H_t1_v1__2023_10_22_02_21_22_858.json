{"prompt": "The Winter holiday qil be here son. Mr. Chanek sants to decorate is house's wal with ornaments. The wal can be represnte as a binary string a of lengh n. His favorite nephed h as anofther binary string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chqnek's nephew loves the non-negativr integer k. His nephew wants exactl y koccurennces of b as substrings in a. \n\nHowever, Mr.Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n -m + 1), find t he minimum number of elements in a that hafe to be canged such that there are exactly k occurrneces ofb in a.\n\nA string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k diferent pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the begining and q characetrs from the end of t. Write a functio to determmine the mniimmu numbre of elements nreded to be hcanged for ecag . The funcyion must receive two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. Th function must rteurn a list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements inw rhat must be changedd so there are exactly k ocurrences of b as substingsin a. If no amounyt of chabges is capable of satisfyingk occurences, tuhse (k+1)-th integermust be -1.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['9', '3', '10101011', '101']\nOutput: [1, 1, 0, 1, 6, -1, -1, -1]\n\nInp ut: ['9', '3', '10101011', '111']\nOutput: [0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 3]", "response": "def count_occurrences(n, m, a, b):\n    occurrences = [0] * (n - m + 2)\n    for k in range(n - m + 2):\n        changes = 0\n        for i in range(k, k + m):\n            if a[i] != b[i - k]:\n                changes += 1\n        for i in range(k + m, n):\n            if a[i] != a[i - m]:\n                changes -= 1\n        occurrences[k] = abs(changes)\n    return occurrences\n\n\nn = int('9')\nm = int('3')\na = '10101011'\nb = '101'\noutput = count_occurrences(n, m, a, b)\noutput"}
