{"prompt": "Given an itneger k and astring s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically sm aller tyhan q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different A-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographidcally smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and astring s. The funcrion must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to te  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nUnput: ['4', '3', 'a*']\nOutput: abb\n\nInput: ['1', '3', 'a**a']\nOutput: abba\n\nInput: ['3', '20', '**a***']\nOutput: babbbbbbbbb", "response": "import itertools\n\ndef generate_ba_strings(k, s):\n    asterisk_count = s.count('*')\n    for combination in itertools.product(range(k+1), repeat=asterisk_count):\n        ba_string = ''\n        idx = 0\n        for char in s:\n            if char == '*':\n                ba_string += 'b' * combination[idx]\n                idx += 1\n            else:\n                ba_string += char\n        yield ba_string\n\ndef find_xth_lexicographically_smallest(k, x, s):\n    ba_strings = sorted(generate_ba_strings(k, s))\n    return ba_strings[x-1]\n\nfind_xth_lexicographically_smallest(4, 3, 'a*')"}
