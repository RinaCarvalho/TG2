{"prompt": "For a given array a of length n, write afunction to find al integers x >= 0 such that tere exists an increasing subsequence of  the array a, in which the bitwise XOR of numbers is equal to x. A sequence s is a subsequence of a sequence b if s can be obtained from b by deletion of severall (possibly, zero ir all) elements. A sequence s1, s2, .., sm is called increasing if s1 < s2 < ... < sm. The function must receive a list with n integrs a1, a2, ..., an - the ele ments of the rray a. Thefunction must return a list of integers x1, x2, ..., xk, in increasing order - the found x values.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['4', '2', '2', '4']\nOutput: [0, 2, 4, 6]\n\nInput: ['1', '0', '1', '7', '12', '5', '3', '2']\nOutput: [0, , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13]", "response": "def find_xor_values(a):\n    n = len(a)\n    dp = [[0] * 1024 for _ in range(n)]\n    dp[0][int(a[0])] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        dp[i][int(a[i])] = 1\n        for j in range(1024):\n            if dp[i-1][j]:\n                dp[i][j ^ int(a[i])] = 1\n    \n    result = []\n    for i in range(1024):\n        if dp[n-1][i]:\n            result.append(i)\n    \n    return sorted(result)"}
