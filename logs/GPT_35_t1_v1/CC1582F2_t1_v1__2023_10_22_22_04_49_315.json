{"prompt": "For a given array a of length n, write afunction to find al integers x >= 0 such that tere exists an increasing subsequence of  the array a, in which the bitwise XOR of numbers is equal to x. A sequence s is a subsequence of a sequence b if s can be obtained from b by deletion of severall (possibly, zero ir all) elements. A sequence s1, s2, .., sm is called increasing if s1 < s2 < ... < sm. The function must receive a list with n integrs a1, a2, ..., an - the ele ments of the rray a. Thefunction must return a list of integers x1, x2, ..., xk, in increasing order - the found x values.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['4', '2', '2', '4']\nOutput: [0, 2, 4, 6]\n\nInput: ['1', '0', '1', '7', '12', '5', '3', '2']\nOutput: [0, , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13]", "response": "def find_x(a):\n    n = len(a)\n    res = set()\n    for i in range(1, 2**n):\n        subset = [a[j] for j in range(n) if (i & (1 << j)) != 0]\n        xor_sum = subset[0]\n        for num in subset[1:]:\n            xor_sum ^= num\n        res.add(xor_sum)\n    return sorted(list(res))"}
