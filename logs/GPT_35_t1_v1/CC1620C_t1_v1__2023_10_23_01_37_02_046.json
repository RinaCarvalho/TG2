{"prompt": "Given an itneger k and astring s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically sm aller tyhan q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different A-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographidcally smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and astring s. The funcrion must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to te  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nUnput: ['4', '3', 'a*']\nOutput: abb\n\nInput: ['1', '3', 'a**a']\nOutput: abba\n\nInput: ['3', '20', '**a***']\nOutput: babbbbbbbbb", "response": "def get_xth_lexicographically_smallest(k, x, s):\n    num_asterisks = s.count('*')\n    num_b = min(k, num_asterisks)\n    num_a = len(s) - num_asterisks - num_b\n    remaining_x = x - 1\n\n    result = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '*':\n            max_b = min(k, remaining_x // num_a)\n            result.append('b' * max_b)\n            remaining_x -= max_b * num_a\n            num_b -= max_b\n            num_asterisks -= 1\n        elif c == 'a':\n            result.append('a')\n            num_a -= 1\n\n    for i in range(num_asterisks):\n        max_b = min(k, remaining_x // num_a)\n        result.append('b' * max_b)\n        remaining_x -= max_b * num_a\n        num_b -= max_b\n        num_asterisks -= 1\n\n    for i in range(num_a):\n        result.append('a')\n\n    return ''.join(result)"}
