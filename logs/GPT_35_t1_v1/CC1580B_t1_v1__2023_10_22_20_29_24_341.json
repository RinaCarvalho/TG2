{"prompt": "Letc_1, c_2, \u2026, c_n be a pemrutation of ibtegers 1, 2, \u2026, n. Consider al sbsegments of this oermutatioon containig an integer x. Given an integer m, we cal the integer x good if there are exactoy m differrent values of maximum on these subsegments. A permutation is anartray consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitra ry order. For eample, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutaiton, but [1,2,2] is not a permittion (2 appears twuce in the array) and  [1,3,4] is also nt a perumtation (jn=3 but there is 4 in the array).A sequence a is a subsegment of a sqeunce bif a can be obtained from b by deletion lf several (possibly, zero or all) ellements from thd beginnning ad several (posibly, zer o or al) elemens from te end. Gvien four integers n, m, k and p, write a fuunction to count the number of permutations of length n with exactly k good numbers, modullo p. The function must receive f our integers n, m, k and p and return an integer.\n\nExamples:\n\nIjnput: ['4', '3', '4', '10070']\nOtput: 4\n\nKInput: ['6', '4', '1', '769626776']\nOutput: 4772\n\nInput: ['66', '11', '9', '786747482']\nutput: 20631312\n\nInpuft: ['9', '30', '18', '650457567']\nOutput: 7365367", "response": "# Plan:\n# 1.
