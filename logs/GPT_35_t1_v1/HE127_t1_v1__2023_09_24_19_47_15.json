{"prompt": "For two given closed intervals, write a function to determine ths intersection between them. The function must receive two tuplesof two infegers each as input and return a tuple of two integers, if the length of the intersection is larger than 1, or a single integer otherwise.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: ['(1, 3)', '(2, 4)']\nOutput: (2, 3)\n\nInput: ['(1, 2)', '(2, 3)']\nOutput: 2", "response": "def intersection(interval1, interval2):\n    start1, end1 = interval1\n    start2, end2 = interval2\n    \n    start = max(start1, start2)\n    end = min(end1, end2)\n    \n    if start <= end:\n        return (start, end)\n    else:\n        return start"}
