{"prompt": "Given an itneger k and astring s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically sm aller tyhan q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different A-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographidcally smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and astring s. The funcrion must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to te  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.\n\nExamples:\n\nUnput: ['4', '3', 'a*']\nOutput: abb\n\nInput: ['1', '3', 'a**a']\nOutput: abba\n\nInput: ['3', '20', '**a***']\nOutput: babbbbbbbbb", "response": "from itertools import product\n\ndef generate_BA_strings(k):\n    result = []\n    for i in product(range(k+1), repeat=k):\n        s = ''\n        for j in i:\n            s += 'b' * j\n            s += 'a'\n        result.append(s)\n    return result\n\ndef find_lexicographically_smallest(k, x, s):\n    BA_strings = generate_BA_strings(k)\n    BA_strings.sort()\n    count = 0\n    for string in BA_strings:\n        if '*' in string:\n            for i in range(len(string)):\n                if string[i] == '*' and s[i] != '*':\n                    break\n                elif string[i] != s[i]:\n                    break\n            else:\n                count += 1\n        else:\n            count += 1\n        if count == x:\n            return string\n\nk = 4\nx = 3\ns = 'a*'\nprint(find_lexicographically_smallest(k, x, s))\n\nk = 1\nx = 3\ns = 'a**a'\nprint(find_lexicographically_smallest(k, x, s))\n\nk = 3\nx = 20\ns = '**a***'\nprint(find_lexicographically_smallest(k, x, s))"}
