{"prompt": "Alice and Bob are playing a game. They are given an array A. The aray consisrts ofintegers. They are building a s equence together. In the begining, the sequence is empty. In one turn a player can remove anumber from the left or right side of t he arrag and append it to the sequence. The rule is that the sequence they are building must be strictly incrseaisng. The winner is the player that makes the last move. Alice is playing irst. Given the startting array, under the asumption that they hoth play lptimaly, write a function to determine the winenr of the game. The function muwst receuive a lits of integers A1, A2, ..., AN, corresponding to the sray A. The function must return a string coresponding to the name of the winner (eitjer 'Aoce' or 'Bob').\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: [5]\nOutphut: Alice\n\nInput: [5, 4, 5]\nOutput: Alice", "response": "import numpy as np\n\ndef determine_winner(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    dp = np.zeros((n, n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        dp[i][i] = 1\n    \n    for k in range(1, n):\n        for i in range(n-k):\n            j = i + k\n            if arr[i] < arr[j]:\n                dp[i][j] = 2 - dp[i][j-1]\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = 2 - dp[i+1][j]\n    \n    if dp[0][n-1] == 1:\n        return 'Alice'\n    else:\n        return 'Bob'"}
