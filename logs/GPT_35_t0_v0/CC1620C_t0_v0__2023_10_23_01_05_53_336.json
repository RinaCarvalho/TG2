{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.", "response": "```python\ndef generate_ba_string(k, x, s):\n    def backtrack(index, current_str):\n        if index == len(s):\n            nonlocal count\n            count += 1\n            if count == x:\n                return current_str\n            return ''\n        \n        if s[index] == '*':\n            for i in range(k+1):\n                result = backtrack(index+1, current_str + 'b'*i)\n                if result:\n                    return result\n        else:\n            return backtrack(index+1, current_str + s[index])\n\n    count = 0\n    return backtrack(0, '')"}
