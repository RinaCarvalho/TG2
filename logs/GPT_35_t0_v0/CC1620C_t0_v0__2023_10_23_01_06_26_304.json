{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.", "response": "from itertools import product\n\ndef compute_lex_smallest(k, x, s):\n    count = s.count('*')\n    combinations = product(range(k + 1), repeat=count)\n    combinations = sorted(combinations)\n\n    for comb in combinations:\n        new_string = s.replace('*', '{}').format(*comb)\n        if x == 1:\n            return new_string\n        x -= 1\n    \n    return \"\""}
