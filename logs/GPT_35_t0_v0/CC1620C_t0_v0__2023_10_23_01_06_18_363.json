{"prompt": "Given an integer k and a string s, that consists only of characters 'a' and '*', each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisks can be replaced with different counts of the letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string. A string p is lexicographically smaller than q if and only if one of the following holds: p is a prefix of q, but p != q, or in the first position where p and q differ, the string p has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in q. Now consider all different BA-strings and write a function to find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. The function must receive two integers k and x, and a string s. The function must return a string consisting only of 'b's and 'a's, corresponding to the  the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.", "response": "def ba_string(k, x, s):\n    def get_num_b(s):\n        num_b = 0\n        for char in s:\n            if char == '*':\n                num_b += 1\n        return num_b\n\n    def generate_ba_strings(prefix, num_b):\n        if num_b == 0:\n            return [prefix]\n        \n        ba_strings = []\n        for i in range(k + 1):\n            ba_strings.extend(generate_ba_strings(prefix + 'b' * i, num_b - 1))\n        \n        return ba_strings\n    \n    num_b = get_num_b(s)\n    ba_strings = generate_ba_strings('', num_b)\n    ba_strings.sort()\n    return ba_strings[x - 1] if x <= len(ba_strings) else ''"}
