{"prompt": "Let c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_n be a permutation of integers 1, 2, \u2026, n. Consider all subsegments of this permutation containing an integer x. Given an integer m, we call the integer x good if there are exactly m different values of maximum on these subsegments. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). A sequence a is a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Given four integers n, m, k and p, write a function to count the number of permutations of length n with exactly k good numbers, modulo p. The function must receive four integers n, m, k and p and return an integer.", "response": "\n\ndef count_permutations(n, m, k, p):\n    #initialize count to 0\n    count = 0\n    \n    #iterate over all permutations of length n\n    for perm in permutations(range(1, n+1)):\n        #initialize the maximum list\n        max_list = []\n        \n        #iterate over all subsegments\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i+1, n+1):\n                subseg = perm[i:j]\n                \n                #find the maximum value in the subsegment\n                max_val = max(subseg)\n                \n                #if the maximum value is not already in the max_list, add it\n                if max_val not in max_list:\n                    max_list.append(max_val)\n                    \n                    #if the number of different maximum values in the max_list is equal to m,\n                    #increment count by 1 and break out of the loop\n                    if len(max_list) == m:\n                        count += 1\n                        break\n            #if count is equal to k, break out of the loop\n            if count == k:\n                break\n        #if count is equal to k, break out of the loop\n        if count == k:\n            break\n    \n    #return the count modulo p\n    return count % p\n    \n"}
