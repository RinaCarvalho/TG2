{"prompt": "The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t. Write a function to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there are exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.", "response": "def min_changes_needed(n, m, a, b):\n    occurrences = [0] * (n - m + 2)\n\n    for k in range(n - m + 1):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(k, n - m + 1):\n            found = True\n            for j in range(m):\n                if a[i + j] != b[j]:\n                    found = False\n                    break\n            if found:\n                count += 1\n        if count == k:\n            occurrences[k + 1] = 0\n        else:\n            occurrences[k + 1] = -1\n\n    return occurrences"}
