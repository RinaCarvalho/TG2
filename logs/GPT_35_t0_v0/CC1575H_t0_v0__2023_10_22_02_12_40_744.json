{"prompt": "The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b of length m (m \u2264 n).\n\nMr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. \n\nHowever, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.\n\nA string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t. Write a function to determine the minimum number of elements needed to be changed for each k. The function must receive two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b, of lengths n and m. The function must return a list with (n - m + 2) integers, where the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that must be changed so there are exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. If no amount of changes is capable of satisfying k occurrences, the (k+1)-th integer must be -1.", "response": "def count_occurrences(a, b):\n    n, m = len(a), len(b)\n    k_occurrences = [0] * (n - m + 2)\n    \n    for k in range(n - m + 1):\n        changes_needed = 0\n        \n        for i in range(k * (m - 1) + 1, (k + 1) * (m - 1) + 2):\n            if a[i:i + m - 1] != b[:m - 1]:\n                changes_needed += 1\n        \n        if a[(k + 1) * (m - 1) + 1:] != b[m - 1:]:\n            changes_needed += 1\n        \n        k_occurrences[k + 1] = changes_needed\n    \n    return k_occurrences"}
