{"prompt": "For two given integers l and n, write a function to calculate the area of a regular polygon with l as the length of its sides and n as the number of its sides. The function must receive two integers as inputs and return a number with three precision points.", "response": "import math\n\ndef calculate_area(l, n):\n    side_length = float(l)\n    num_sides = float(n)\n    area = (num_sides * side_length**2) / (4 * math.tan(math.pi/num_sides))\n    return round(area, 3)"}
