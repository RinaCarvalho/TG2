{"prompt": "Let c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_n be a permutation of integers 1, 2, \u2026, n. Consider all subsegments of this permutation containing an integer x. Given an integer m, we call the integer x good if there are exactly m different values of maximum on these subsegments. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). A sequence a is a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Given four integers n, m, k and p, write a function to count the number of permutations of length n with exactly k good numbers, modulo p. The function must receive four integers n, m, k and p and return an integer.", "response": "def count_permutations(n, m, k, p):\n    def calculate_subsegment_maximums(permutation):\n        max_values = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            subsegments = [permutation[i:j+1] for j in range(i, n)]\n            maximum = max([max(subsegment) for subsegment in subsegments])\n            max_values.append(maximum)\n        return max_values\n    \n    def count_good_numbers(permutation):\n        max_values = calculate_subsegment_maximums(permutation)\n        return len(set(max_values)) == m\n    \n    def generate_permutations_helper(curr_permutation, k, p, result):\n        if len(curr_permutation) == n:\n            if count_good_numbers(curr_permutation):\n                result.append(curr_permutation)\n        else:\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                if i not in curr_permutation:\n                    generate_permutations_helper(curr_permutation + [i], k, p, result)\n    \n    permutations = []\n    generate_permutations_helper([], k, p, permutations)\n    return len(permutations) % p"}
