{"prompt": "Let c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_n be a permutation of integers 1, 2, \u2026, n. Consider all subsegments of this permutation containing an integer x. Given an integer m, we call the integer x good if there are exactly m different values of maximum on these subsegments. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). A sequence a is a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Given four integers n, m, k and p, write a function to count the number of permutations of length n with exactly k good numbers, modulo p. The function must receive four integers n, m, k and p and return an integer.", "response": "def count_permutations(n, m, k, p):\n    # generate all possible permutations of length n\n    permutations = [[i+1 for i in range(n)]]\n\n    # iterate over each integer x from 1 to n\n    for x in range(1, n+1):\n        # generate all subsegments containing x\n        subsegments = []\n        for permutation in permutations:\n            for i in range(len(permutation)):\n                for j in range(i+1, len(permutation)+1):\n                    subsegment = permutation[i:j]\n                    if x in subsegment:\n                        subsegments.append(subsegment)\n        \n        # count the number of different maximum values in each subsegment\n        max_counts = []\n        for subsegment in subsegments:\n            max_count = len([num for num in subsegment if num == max(subsegment)])\n            max_counts.append(max_count)\n\n        # check if x is a good number based on the count of different maximum values\n        if len(set(max_counts)) == m:\n            # filter out permutations that do not contain x in any subsegment\n            permutations = [permutation for permutation in permutations if x in permutation]\n\n    # count the number of permutations with exactly k good numbers\n    count = len(permutations)\n\n    # return the count modulo p\n    return count % p"}
