{"prompt": "Polycarp likes squares and cubes of positive integers. Here is the beginning of the sequence of numbers he likes: 1, 4, 8, 9, .... For a given number n, write a function to count the number of integers from 1 to n that Polycarp likes. In other words, find the number of such x that x is a square of a positive integer number or a cube of a positive integer number (or both a square and a cube simultaneously). The function must receive an integer n, and return an integer.", "response": "\ndef count_numbers(n):\n    count = 0\n    sqrt_max = int(n ** 0.5)\n    cube_max = int(n ** (1/3))\n\n    for i in range(1, sqrt_max + 1):\n        if i ** 2 <= n:\n            count += 1\n\n    for i in range(1, cube_max + 1):\n        if i ** 3 <= n and i ** 2 != i ** 3:\n            count += 1\n\n    return count\n"}
