{"prompt": "Let c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_n be a permutation of integers 1, 2, \u2026, n. Consider all subsegments of this permutation containing an integer x. Given an integer m, we call the integer x good if there are exactly m different values of maximum on these subsegments. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). A sequence a is a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Given four integers n, m, k and p, write a function to count the number of permutations of length n with exactly k good numbers, modulo p. The function must receive four integers n, m, k and p and return an integer.", "response": "\ndef count_permutations(n, m, k, p):\n    dp = [[0] * (k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(k+1):\n            for x in range(1, min(i, m)+1):\n                if j >= x:\n                    dp[i][j] += dp[i-x][j-x]\n                    dp[i][j] %= p\n    \n    return dp[n][k]\n\nn = 5\nm = 2\nk = 1\np = 10**9 + 7\ncount_permutations(n, m, k, p)\n"}
